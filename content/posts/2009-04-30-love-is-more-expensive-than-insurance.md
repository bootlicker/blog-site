Watched a couple of body snatchers peel this man from the ground, take another from the kurb. I was half asleep in the car, I couldn't remember where everyone else had gone - inside and upstairs, I guess, I remember someone saying something about money for food later on, the guys knew where my stuff was.<br/><br/>I watched them talk to each other, nothing on their faces, their faces nothing. Like little puppets. Little happy puppets, strung to something else. Or maybe they stole bodies for fun.<br/><br/>Big jumpers on a warm night, and they packed the people into a Nissan hatchback. We looked at each other before they drove off, I smiled, so did they. I hope I see them next week. I'm out of town next week.<br/><br/>Maybe the week after. I don't know. Everyone lives across the road from a graveyard, I just live across from a real one.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-3800072567984805108?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
