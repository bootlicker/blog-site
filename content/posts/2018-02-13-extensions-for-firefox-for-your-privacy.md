I recommend these extensions for your browser, to increase the security of your web experience, and to attempt to protect your privacy:

&#8211; HTTPS Everywhere
  
&#8211; NoScript
  
&#8211; Privacy Badger
  
&#8211; uBlock Origin

I currently have &#8220;Disconnect&#8221; installed, but I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s actually helping at all. Ask me about it later.
