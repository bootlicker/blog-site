He owned a jacket with a metal zip. At times this could cause him great discomfort due to the garment's inflexibility, but he'd be rewarded later by it's longevity.<br/><br/>Because honestly, everyone wants to wear the same clothes for decades.<br/><br/>Why comment on the quality of someone's carpet? Why? Why did he do it? It seemed completely outlandish to me at the time, and I was most certainly confused when the host took his remark as a complement. <br/><br/>Not only that but it frustrated me that everyone liked him, he was constantly looking out for everyone else. He's selfless, there's not doubt.<br/><br/>Then he told me something I'm probably never going to forget. Forget the complete amazement I was in that he actually sought after MY wellbeing, I believed him. I couldn't help it.<br/><br/>He met the devil. Seriously, the devil exists. He's not that cheesy stereotype though. He's not the red devil with horns and a tail with a trident pitchfork. Yeah sure, I know. You've read and heard these clich√©d movies and books redefining the devil.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-8175531145658469710?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
