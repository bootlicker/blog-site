I wouldn't normally complain to my blog<br/><br/>...literally...<br/><br/>but, this shit is weird.<br/><br/>- I dream about Zac shaving my head, and then The Large Man murdering my family<br/><br/>- I walk out of my house toothless<br/><br/>- I find my powercable in the middle of the park before the bus stop<br/><br/>- A man at uni wouldn't stop looking at me and shoving his hands down the front of his pants<br/><br/>- EA sends us an angry email<br/><br/>- Guild cafe isn't selling fried noodles AGAIN<br/><br/>- I'm going to a quiz night with a table of people who hate me<br/><br/>This doesn't exactly make my life bad, but its doing a great job of making me feel like I'm on the Truman Show.<br/><br/>OH BLAIR. WON'T YOU VICTIMISE YOURSELF JUST A BIT MORE?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-8078295141454145539?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
