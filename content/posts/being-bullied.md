My excitement for learning and me craving an active, participatory
style of learning saw me heavily punished by my teachers.

I assume I was considered disruptive, and an upstart by my grade 4
teacher, because all I wanted to do was attempt to answer every
question.

I would sit there with my hand raised for every question, and was
ignored.

I now have a terrible complex where I feel like if someone disagrees
with me, they are attacking me or will abandon or disassociate
themselves from me. It makes it difficult for me to respond to
corrections and feedback.

I was bullied by my teachers. And all I wanted was to learn. I resent
that I was considered a drag on other children's learning, or that
somehow there was not enough resources for all the children in my
massive classes in my government grade school.

I went to an expensive high school, but by that stage I had the
habitual mental process drilled into me.

I am going to work hard on correcting this internal ethic that I practice.

Seriously I really despise the fact that some of my teachers thought
the best way to deal with me was to take me down a notch.
