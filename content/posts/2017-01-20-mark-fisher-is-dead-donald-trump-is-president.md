I would like to inaugurate this new phase in world history with a new phase in my presence online. I will no longer be making status updates on Facebook. I will also not be sharing memes on Facebook.

I suppose if I find some good memes online I will now share them here on this blog. I agree with one of my comrades that memes are a revolutionary medium of communication. I think the revolution will be memed, if not televised. To a certain extent I&#8217;m of two minds about the medium, however, because almost all bigotry online is conducted through memes, and the place where memes were born, 4chan, is a disgustingly degenerate place.
