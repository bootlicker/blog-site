Hey everyone. 

I just thought I'd make a quick video about the Australian Federal 
Election. So it seems like the Labor Party have been soundly defeated by the 
Liberal-National Coalition--the right wing party--in the election. 

And a lot of people have wanted to know why, and what it means: and basically 
Australians don't trust a right-wing social democratic message. 

It's also been the way the Labor Party campaigned. In NSW for instance it has 
been shown that a lot the working class suburbs had a swing towards the Liberal 
Party. A translation for American people: the right wing party in Australia is 
called the Liberal Party, and the Centre-Left or notionally Centre-Left party 
in Australia is called the Labor Party. So the Labor Party had a swing towards 
them in the rich suburbs, and the Liberal Party had a swing towards them in the 
poorer suburbs, the working class suburbs. So it's really interesting to see 
that the Labor Party haven't been organising the traditional base that they 
need to be organising. They haven't been targeting the people that they need to 
be targeting, like the way Jeremy Corbyn has. They main problem is that we 
can't have a Jeremy Corbyn or a Bernie Sanders-type effect because there's 
no-one in parliament like them. It's really depressing. And also the Labor Party 
is really undemocratic. Someone like Jeremy Corbyn was able to be elected 
because they opened up their preselection procedures. In the Labor Party in 
Australia, we don't have any kind of democratic one-vote one-person procedures 
like they do in the UK Labour Party, so it's not really possible for us to get 
someone like Jeremy Corbyn elected, even if there was someone like that in 
parliament. 

One really cool thing, though, is that in about 3 different electorates across 
Melbourne, there were about 5% primary votes for Victorian Socialists, which is 
really good. The Victorian Socialists are this really cool party that is an 
alliance between a lot of different left groups in Victoria. 

The main problem is though is that the battleground was Queensland in the 
Federal Election. And the wishy-washy nature of the Labor Party going soft on 
Adani, or opposing Adani sometimes but saying they were going to open up 
Queensland and the Northern Territory for gas piping and gas fracking is 
confusing, and I've seen a lot of people say that the Labor Party judged the 
mood and interests of Queensland well because apparently people in Queensland 
are racist or more concerned with their jobs than the environment. But I don't 
really think so. I think that we haven't had that time, or we haven't had the 
will or volition by the major parties to raise the issue and have a discussion 
with people in Queensland. So it's complex. 

I personally feel like this is the Milliband moment of the Labor Party in 
Australia. So, Ed Milliband was the son of Ralph Milliband, and Ed Milliband was 
the last Labour leader before Jeremy Corbyn, before they had an election. Ed 
Milliband was accused of being too left-wing in his policies, and that's 
basically all the commentary I've seen about Bill Shorten and his campaign. Bill 
Shorten was the leader of the Labor Party before he lost the election. And of 
course this is nonsense. I really do think that a far-left message of jobs AND 
the environment would have really resonated with a lot of people in Queensland. 
It's interesting because I was seeing a lot discussion about where the 
battleground of the election be, and a lot of people thought it was Victoria 
because the Labor Party did really well in the state election with "my friend, 
your friend" Daniel Andrews: supposedly the most left-wing Premier in Australia. 
But they're returning 3 Liberal senators, so the proportional vote actually 
isn't that closer towards Labor winning, or persuading more people. So it was a 
bit of a toss-up. A lot of people kept asking, "What about WA?", but Western 
Australia doesn't have enough seats to influence a majority inside the 
Australian Parliament. So, I guess that's my two cents. That's my opinion on 
the Australian election. 

Bill Shorten personally is just a hack. He was known to 
have knifed BOTH Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, and really, the Australia public 
know this guy believes nothing. This guy really stands for nothing, has had no 
principled stance on anything, and will say whatever is necessary to win. So 
personally, Bill Shorten is really hated. 

And I think sometimes the Victorian Socialists is a bit of a "bubble" 
phenomenon. When you're living in the inner city of Melbourne, it's wonderful 
that we've had these kinds of victories, but have they translated to reaching 
out to other parts of Australia. 

The Labor Party's pseudo-left policies: a lot of commentators said, "Labor took 
a chance and made a statement"--the Labor party made STATEMENTS, but people 
don't really believe them--Labor, that is, they don't actually really believe 
what they're trying to say. So we don't really have someone who has been in the 
fight for a long time and actually really stands for something. So when you get 
given all these promises--and people say "ohh, yeah okay... :-\" And also, a lot 
of their principled policy came out in the election campaign. It wasn't 
actually prosecuted over the last three years. 

I guess that's the biggest thing that Australians have noticed: that the Labor 
Party have this massive small target strategy, they banked everything on doing 
nothing--up until the election when they popped up a bunch of policies. I guess 
that just didn't translate--maybe it did translate? The free dental care stuff, 
for pensioners. But they're just untrustworthy. 

Why would you trust the Labor Party? 

I certainly don't.
