1. The ideal political consciousness for any individual is the consciousness that is most true to their class position under capitalism.
2. Many people agree with this judgement, but despair when they come into contact with people who exhibit consciousness that is not true to their class position. This is called ''empirical'' consciousness.
3. So what is class consciousness, either ideal or empirical? It is not the contents of a person's brain, as if their brain was a box full of facts like photographs. A person's brain is also not like the central processing unit of a computer, taking discrete sensory inputs and calculating decisions based on algorithms. Consciousness is also not like a bank account--as if the brain were ''opened'' in the bank of knowledge at the beginning of personal individuality and sapience.
4. The whole body thinks. What is really happening when somebody exhibits consciousness is they are demonstrating skilled coping with respect to their environment, be it social or non-social.
5. There are no such things as ''ideas'' in the ordinary common sense. Ideas, the supposed contents of brains, and apparent judgements with which people act, do not exist.
6. The only way we can describe human ''consciousness'' as existing is through the observation of the entities which guide and cause organisms to better cope with their environment--habits.
7. Habits are the processes of the body through which sapient and sentient creatures cope with their environment, be their environment personal or social, or inanimate and natural-scientific.
8. The only way we can say someone exhibits some problematic or contradictory ''idea'' is the enumeration of the ways in which their political and social habits are not true of their class position.
