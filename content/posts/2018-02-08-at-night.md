I feel lonely and sad at night. I sleep in a different room from my partner to improve my sleep (it works), but being apart makes me sad.

I wish my partner didn&#8217;t have to go and work full time. All I wanna do is be with Charmaine.

In 2015, we were under-employed and we had a lot of time together. I really enjoyed that year. Also the first year we went out, 2014 &#8211; when I basically started living at Charmaine&#8217;s parent&#8217;s place.

I felt really emotional today &#8211; this Japanese romantic drama we were watching has had a big effect on me. I&#8217;m coming down off my anti-psychotic meds and I fee like my emotions are less muted &#8211; it&#8217;s a strange feeling and I find it hard to handle!

I love Charmaine. She means everthing to me.
