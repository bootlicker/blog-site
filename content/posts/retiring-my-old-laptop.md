well this little old i3-2350M dell inspiron laptop is soon to be retired

i have had it since 2011, and it was shitty even back then

but it has never died, never complained, never needed repairing.

it is still working, but i am being gifted a lenovo X230, so it is time for an 
upgrade.

i never named this laptop, but i guess now that it is being put out to pasture, 
i think maybe i might name it.

maybe... AUGUSTINICS
