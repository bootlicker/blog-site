overall impressions of using windows for the first time in... well, let's just 
say a long time:

sure you can boot up a game in it, but the game will crash at critical points. 
everything is really locked down, and in order to do anything remotely hackerish 
you will end up with a folder of weird EXEs that you feel nervous running 
because you can't view the source, and they're from weird places on the internet 
with a lot of ads.

there are adverts everywhere in the operating system's display, and... it feels 
kind of... 'cheap' - like microsoft doesn't care about windows. it just looks 
and sounds cheap.

by contrast linux, BSD, and free desktop environments look really glossy, or 
matte, and seem really responsive

OH! yes, on the topic of responsive: windows will just lock up for no reason 
sometimes. and there's nothing you can do about it.

i think the one things i like best about windows is the metallic grinding noise 
you get when it crashes and diplays a BSOD

i will routinely yell YAY IT'S BROKEN when that happens.

overall score: annoying/10
