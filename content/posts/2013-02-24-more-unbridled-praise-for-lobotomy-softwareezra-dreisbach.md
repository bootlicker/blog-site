It&#8217;s worth re-mentioning the virtues of putting effort into good game design in connection with the Sega Saturn once more before it gets old.

[In this interview][1] (with, again, Ezra Dreisbach) about the Saturn port of Quake, the reader can find more evidence of Lobotomy Software&#8217;s attention to detail in their game design. For quick reference, compare the quality of the level design between the _Saturn_ and the _N64 _in these two screenshots:

**N64**

**Saturn**

Needless to say, the _N64_ might have featured better hardware, but _Saturn_ owners were rewarded with a better game. Of particular note is Dreisbach&#8217;s [repeated attention][4] to dynamic lighting.
