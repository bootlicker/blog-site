# 0.0 Introduction

This paper will describe, and then compare and contrast, two very different 
‘second-language’ acquisition activities. The underlying philosophical 
viewpoints that underpin each of the activities will also be drawn out and 
discussed. The advantages and short-comings of each of the approaches underlying 
the two activities considered in the paper will be elucidated. The two 
activities and respective language-acquisition approaches discussed in this 
paper are (a) a memorisation activity, and its corresponding behaviourist 
underpinning; and (b) a social peer-interview report exercise and its 
corresponding social constructivist underpinning. It will be argued that while 
memorisation activities such as the one discussed in the paper are almost 
universally incorporated as some component of ‘second-language’ acquisition, its 
philosophical underpinning is fundamentally flawed. Wrote-learning and 
memorisation are a function of the wide-spread social norm that classrooms are 
the best place to learn languages. Memorisation caters to the rationalisation of 
education as an ‘outcomes based’ practice, which reifies human existence. 
Against the behaviourist philosophical underpinning of memorisation activities 
and its attendant consequences for education, it will be argued that a social 
constructivist position should be taken towards language acquisition, such as 
that embodied in the chosen activity presented.

## 1.1.0 -- Description of Activities

### 1.1.1 -- Activity One

The first activity considered in this paper is a very simple one, but it is 
more or less ubiquitous within language acquisition programs. It is actually 
two different activities, but since the theoretical assumptions underpinning 
those two activities are so similar, they will be considered together as one 
unit, to give a broader and fuller understanding of those theoretical 
assumptions.

The first part of activity one is the memorisation of common English phrases 
such as ‘good morning!’, ‘how are you?’, and ‘congratulations!’ The L1 
associated with this part of the activity is French, although one could just as 
easily transfer the activity into any other L1. The substantial content of the 
activity consists in having the English phrases (L2) to be learned placed 
alongside their equivalent French counterparts (L1). The execution of the 
activity could be oral, aural, or written. It would involve memorising the form 
and content of the English (L2) phrases with regard to the original French (L1) 
form and content.

The second part of the activity is the memorisation of English homophones. 
Homophones are words that sound the same, but have different meanings, and 
sometimes different spellings. Homophones are particularly difficult to learn 
because they seem at first quite arbitrary. This appearance of arbitrariness 
usually leads to activities such as this one, which are based on memorisation 
and wrote-learning. The purpose of this activity is to memorise the English (L2) 
words that are equivalent to the learner’s L1. Again, the execution of this 
activity could be oral, aural, written, or some combination of the three.

### 1.1.2 -- Activity Two
The second activity considered by this paper is called ‘conversation grid’. A 
grid of questions is drawn up, and learners must converse and interact with 
one-another using their L2 in order to record answers to the questions on the 
grid. The activity is first modelled by the teacher and another student, or by 
two students, and then learners go off by themselves and learn via their peers. 
A key facet of this activity is that it stresses minimal teacher authority. 
Learners are encouraged to try dialogue for themselves and ‘muddle through’.
The activity can be as easy or as difficult as the level of command of English 
of the learners requires. Beginner learners would discuss and record information 
about other’s hobbies, likes and dislikes, or occupations. More advanced 
learners could discuss more abstract topics, and could be required to write more 
fuller and complex written answers to the prescribed questions.
The purpose of activity two is to involve learners in social interaction, as 
opposed to the first activity. Activity two emphasises the communication of 
meaning, as opposed to the mastery of technical linguistic forms.

## 1.2.0 -- Theoretical Underpinnings of Activities

The two activities that were chosen to be considered in this paper are based on 
very different views about personhood, the mind, and learning. The two different 
views manifested in the above two activities will now be considered.

## 1.2.1 -- Activity One

The theoretical assumptions about the mind and the person that underpin the 
first activity can be collectively labelled ‘behaviourism’. Behaviourism, as its 
name suggests, asserts that the truth about someone’s learning is located in 
their behaviour, and not in their consciousness. It is argued that behaviourism 
is a persuasive way of viewing learning because of the claim that ‘behavioural 
change can be perceived objectively and can therefore be measured’ (Louw, 
1993: 220). Behaviourism proceeds from the view that

>what we have learned cannot be directly perceived; but the resulting change in 
behaviour or performance can be. On the basis of our performance, it can be 
deduced what and how much we have learned (Louw, 1993: 220).

Behaviourism proceeds from the vulgar materialist and empiricist view of the 
mind that asserts that because consciousness does not disclose itself as 
physical or material substance, it shouldn’t be considered as actually real. The 
resulting theoretical framework that results from this philosophical assumption 
resolves all human behaviour into ‘stimuli’ and ‘responses’. The process by 
which a stimulus results in a response is called a ‘reflex’. 
Behaviourism treats learning as ‘conditioning’. Conditioning is the behaviourist 
concept for the process whereby a person’s the physical environment is altered 
in such a way that they develop new reflexes in order to deal with new stimuli.

## 1.2.2 -- Activity Two

The learning theory called ‘social constructivism’ underpins the second 
activity. If behaviourism can be said to be the ‘most primitive’ form of 
descriptive and explanatory paradigm for learning, social constructivism could 
be said to be ‘two notches above it’.

The branch of social constructivism that will be accounted for here will be what 
has been termed ‘activity theory’. Activity theory developed out of Lev 
Vygotsky’s research on educational psychology. It is premised on dialectical 
materialism, a metaphysics that was developed in an attempt to resolve the 
‘antimonies [contradictions] of bourgeois thought’ (Ilyenkov, 1977). 
Behaviourism is one side of the main contradiction within bourgeois thought. It 
asserts that truth is purely objective and measurable. The other side of the 
contradiction is idealism, which asserts that truth is more or less purely 
seated in the mind. (Whether or not cognitivism falls into this latter category 
is a matter of debate. Some argue cognitivism is merely an eclectic form of 
behaviourism.)

Dialectical materialism, in order to resolve this contradiction (what describes 
explains human being and thought? The environment or human mental states?), 
asserts that ‘it is not [a person’s] consciousness that determines their 
existence, but on the contrary, their social existence that determines their 
consciousness’  (Lukacs, 1971: 18). Activity theory expands on this 
metaphysics by asserting that language is but one component of a body of 
objective, but immaterial, socially constructed thought-forms that mediate 
subjective human interaction with the objective environment (Leontev, 1977).

## 1.3.0 -- Discussion

The purpose of this section, the discussion section, is to compare and contrast 
the two lessons described above. The purpose of this is to explain how they are 
influenced by the above two different theories of language learning. From this 
explanation an argument will be built that asserts that social constructivism 
points to a deeper and fuller understanding of second-language acquisition.
Very briefly, the behaviourist recipe for ‘learning’ an L2 (N.B. this method 
represents ‘classical conditioning’, as opposed to ‘operant conditioning’) is as 
follows:

- Identify the learner’s L1. The learner’s L1 is, for the purposes of the 
L2 acquisition, an ‘unconditioned stimulus’ (UCS) which produces ‘unconditioned 
responses’ (UCR). The UCR in this case is the learner’s comprehension of 
linguistic meaning.

- Pair the UCS with a neutral stimulus, the L2 sought to be ‘learned’. This 
is memorisation and wrote learning.

- Remove the learner’s L1 from the learning environment. Apply to the 
learner the neutral stimulus, the L2, the ‘conditioned stimulus’ (CS), and this 
will elicit comprehension in the learner of the L2, a ‘conditioned response’ 
(CR)  (Louw, 1993: 224).

Abstractly:

- UCS -> UCR
- UCS + CS -> UCR
- CS -> CR

There are two observations that we can make about the first activity and 
its behaviourist theoretical underpinning, and they are all a function of its 
adherence to a strict notion of positivism. First, the acquisition of the L2 is 
treated as discrete ‘appropriation’. In other words, the L2 acquisition is 
conceptualised as a kind of mathematical function:  L2 goes in, comprehension 
comes out. Acquisition happens on one plane of existence. Behaviourists might 
argue that memorisation leads to a process behaviourists label ‘generalisation’, 
which means that wrote-learned words should come to be associated with broader 
contexts of communication, but as Louw & Edwards (Louw, 1993: 231) mention, it 
is not clear whether generalisation is as regular and predictable as 
behaviourists claim.

Second, the substance of the L2 to be learned is treated in a formalist manner. 
It is treated as form without content. In other words, the L2 is treated in 
almost perfect abstraction, within any regard being paid to the kinds of 
contexts in which one would use the language. A possible example of this is the 
complete lack of ability of the memorisation activity to help the learner 
understand the pragmatics that may be involved in communicating meaning using 
the words.

The fundamental basis of both of these observed problems with the memorisation 
activity is that its positivistic, behaviourist underpinning posits a view of 
the human mind and its learning that is passive and ‘contemplative’. It is 
certainly possible for a behaviourist to maintain that language is a dynamic and 
evolving human construction, but the learning process that they advocate asserts 
that language is a monolithic, static body of data that is ready and able to be 
abstracted and appropriated formalistically. 

In this connection we can recall part of Marx’s Theses on Feuerbach:
The chief defect of all materialism up to now ... is that the object, reality, 
what we apprehend through our senses, is understood only in the form of the 
subject or contemplation; but not as sensuous human activity, as practice, ...
 (Ilyenkov, 1977: 224) (Ilyenkov’s emphasis).

What this meant was that

>[people were] considered the passive side of the subject-object relation, as 
the determined member of this inter-relation. Furthermore, man was abstracted 
here from the combination of social relations and transformed into an isolated 
individual. The [human]-environment relations were therefore interpreted as 
individual to all the rest, to everything that lay outside the individual brain 
and existed independently of it  (Ilyenkov, 1977: 225).

But, crucially,

>outside the individual, and independently of his will and consciousness, there 
existed not only nature but also the social historical environment, the world of 
things created by [humanity’s] labour, and the system of relations between 
[person] and [person], developed in the labour process. In other words, not only 
did nature by itself (‘in itself’ [to use Kantian terminology]) lie outside the 
individual, but also humanised nature, altered by labour  (Ilyenkov, 
1977: 225).

The social constructivist underpinning behind the second activity seeks to 
capture and help learners engage with the social historical environment embodied 
within language, within the L2. Although the activity is limited to the 
classroom environment, which is artificial and abstract, it can be hoped that 
the practical execution of the ideas underpinning the activity will lead to the 
development of skills by the learners that will enable them to go out into the 
real world and use language the way it really works: as a cultural tool, an 
artefact that mediates personal access to objective reality.

The advantage of the second activity over the first is that it relies on the 
active participation and involvement of the learner. By conversing with peers 
and the teacher, the learner taps into language’s function as a human cultural 
artefact. Language is a practical, social activity that requires more than just 
individualised, abstract memorisation. It requires grounding in concrete reality 
in order to be truly meaningful. In a sense it is ‘situated’ in different 
cultural activities that require active participation, not passive memorisation 
 (Brown, 1989).

# 3.0.0 -- Conclusion

In this paper, two different activities with very different approaches to 
language acquisition were compared and contrasted. The first activity, based in 
positivistic behaviourist theoretical assumptions about learning and the mind, 
treated language as an abstract, individualised experience. This position on 
language acquisition was argued to be philosophically wanting, lacking in 
substantiation in concrete evidence, and normatively unappealing. 
It was argued that the second activity rectified the shortcomings of the first. 
It viewed language as a body of human cultural signs and understandings that 
mediated subjective interaction with objective reality. Language in this sense 
was argued to be dynamic, and the underpinnings of the second activity’s 
approach was argued to be more powerful in both a descriptive and explanatory 
sense.
