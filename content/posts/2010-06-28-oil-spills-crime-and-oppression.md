<p>Look at those tired, tired eyes. They didn't look directly at the camera - but they got close, so they almost look right at you, or you can imagine that you're a person standing behind the camera. This is one of those really realistic photos where the lighting matches up with the lighting that actually existed at the time of it's taking: The fluoro light bleaches everything, pales everyone's skin in the shot, and casts long shadows in the cracks in the plaster wall in the background.</p>
