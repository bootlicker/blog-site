for the last few months I have been thinking about how to make a simple little 
robot buddy that can walk around in public

This is an example of the feet assembly I imagine the robot to have, but the 
problem with this design, with the feet with the horizontal struts, for balance, 
is that I do not think that it would allow the machine to turn very well.

I will do some more searching... Like most of these ideas I have, I think 
someone else would definitely have had this idea as well...

Another easy idea would be to just give the robot buddy wheels. Or tank tracks. 
The walking aspect of the machine is what attracts me to the idea of having a 
computer that would be able to transport itself along with me, though
