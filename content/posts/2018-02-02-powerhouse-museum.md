It was amazing to go there today! I loved the electromagnets and the theremin.

The neoliberal privatised public transport concepts were hilarious &#8211; especially the Austrans driverless trams. Luckily we have a strong union for public transport workers here in Sydney &#8211; the RTBU.

That hasn&#8217;t stopped the Fair Work Commission and the state government from doing their best to undermine and ruin public transport here in NSW&#8230;
