I live in Sydney.

My PhD enrolment had to be extended by 6 months, and my scholarship has now ended.

I am now living on a real shoestring. Sydney is the third most expensive city in the world.

If you know of any jobs which are going in Sydney, I would love to hear about them.

I have been applying for so many jobs and I am not hearing back from any of them.

I would be so grateful if you had any suggestions.
