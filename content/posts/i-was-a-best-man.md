I just came back from a wonderful wedding. It was of my best friend Jack and his partner. I was the best man. Hopefully I'm not tooting my own horn too much here, but I made an excellent speech. Everyone loved it.

Both Jack and his partner are absolutely wonderful people. We should all follow their example of how they have been able to stick together as a couple and make something bigger and more important than themselves.

Here's to all the people who are looking for someone to support them. :-)
