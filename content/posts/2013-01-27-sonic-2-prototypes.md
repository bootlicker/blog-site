If you&#8217;re interested in looking at all the different decisions that go into making a game&#8211;especially a classic one, such as Sonic 2&#8211;you&#8217;re probably more than captured by things such asÂ _game prototypes_. Check out these two Sonic 2 prototypes: the [Simon Wai][1] prototype, and the [Nick Arcade][2] prototype.
