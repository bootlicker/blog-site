With a brilliant database of concise and analytical PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 game summaries, no longer do you have to resort to head-scratching when it comes to buying or playing your next HuCard.

The centrepiece of this website, however, is its free (!!) magazine [PC Engine Gamer][3]. The author keeps the issues collected in a folder on Issuu.com, among some other magazines, but for ease of access, find each of theÂ _seven_ issues listed here.

Issues [1][4], [2][5], [3][6], [4][7], [5][8], [6][9], [7][10].
