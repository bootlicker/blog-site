Most of them came down last night, at about midnight. I did it because I needed more blue-tack. I might put them back up again, I think I've gotten used to them being there. I'm not sure if it means much anymore, I remember sitting on the end of my bed at looking at it all, feeling kind of complete and hopeful.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>All I do now is sit around and think about it all, I think its making me ill. I think Mum made me do it, but I was unhappy with how I was treated, and then things were said I didn't really like, so for everyone's protection I did it. I'm glad I did, I feel happier now I have my own life, although I wish it hadn't've happened.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>I wrote a counter-curse. I think it's working.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-1545807848800187102?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
