<blockquote>&#13;
<p>I think the knowledge came to him at last - only at the very last. But the wilderness had found him out early, and had taken on him a terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion. I think it had whispered to him things about himself which he did not know, things of which he had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude - and the whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating. It echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core.</p>&#13;

<p><em>The Dark Knight</em> reminds me of <em>Heart of Darkness</em>. This book and movie aren't really anything alike, but both Kurtz and the Joker are terrible people, and in that sense they are the same.</p>&#13;
<p>This passage sums up the whole book, for me, and I think about it.</p>
