'Why are you always in hospital?'<br/><br/>'Because I'm very often sick.'<br/><br/>'You're sick too often.'<br/><br/>Harkoff didn't say anything.<br/><br/>'Why won't you stop?'<br/><br/>'I've got nothing left.'<br/><br/>'That's an awful thing to say. Even if that were true, you'd have more opportunity to do anything.'<br/><br/>'I don't know.'<br/><br/>'You're killing yourself, Plel. Stop it. Stop this, you're not a tool, you don't have to do this, you're not Noska's personal device.'<br/><br/>'I'm already dead.'<br/><br/>'Stop it!'<br/><br/>'I've got nothing left, I have no mind, I am more alive than ever when I can have a surer purpose than I can see the sky is blue, my life has more meaning than anything I can understand.'<br/><br/>'Stop smoking.'<br/><br/>'Why?'<br/><br/>The ceilings are white. The ceilings always irradiate a slow painful white.<br/><br/>'I don't know who you are.'<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-8789555685037992921?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
