Bizarrely underpowered, but able to do push out better full-motion video than any of its fellow fifth-generation peers, the NEC PC-FX occupies another corner of the obscure game console ring. It was only ever released in Japan, but it gained notoriety for being home to pile upon pile of dating sims due to NEC&#8217;s hilarious attempt to boost the console&#8217;s sales by relaxing its game quality control.
