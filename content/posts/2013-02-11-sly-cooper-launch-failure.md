1Up.com absolutely [nails it][1]: the Sony _PlayStation_ exclusive franchise, _Sly_ _Cooper_,_ _has had its first game in eight years only just recently released in the US &#8211; to almost no fanfare. As the article points out, this is puzzling, given Sony&#8217;s decision to launch the game at $US40, and include free access to the _Vita_ version bundled with a PS3 copy. Both of these factors, with some publicity, would do a great deal to help the _Vita&#8217;s _floundering game library profile.

Australia and Europe will have to wait almost 2 months for their official release. Watch this space!
