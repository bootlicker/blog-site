Staying at home for so long has made me realise I have a wonderful communal 
life with my father. We cook together, clean together, and we share a lot of 
family love.

I get to have massive sleeps, and work on electronics and hacking. Yesterday, 
for instance, I had a really nice chill day. My dad's x230 thinkpad arrived, and 
he came home from work and I cooked with him, and then he went back to work.

Something is wholesome about this communal life, and I think we do share a 
communal life together. I hope others get to realise that they share a beautiful 
communal life, at least sometimes, away from the violence of the workplace.
