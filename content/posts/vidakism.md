we need to be kind and patient with one another

and we usually are

but, a lot of us don't start off from the assumption that the person
we are immediately interacting with is reasonable and is actually
*more* than disinterested in our plight

and i get it - i've been massively hurt and burned by people - and you
know what, i have burnt and hurt people.

but our kindness and patience is actually infectious. i do not believe
that empathy is a weakness, or that, most of the time, it will be
abused and exploited

this is my philosophy. i play a long game, as well - do not expect
results immediately - over time, your patience, empathy, and kindness
/will/ be the change you want to see in the world

if i'm allowed to be a little arrogant, i call this interpersonal and
intersectional philosophy:

'vidakism'
