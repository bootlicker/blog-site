<blockquote><strong>A Volvo</strong><br/><br/><strong>.</strong><br/><br/>What beautiful thick doors<br/><br/>this car has!<br/><br/>Somehow, in the back of my mind,<br/><br/>It feels wrong to like such a pollutive machine<br/><br/>Would break everything I believe in<br/><br/>But then again, something pointless always fits me well<br/><br/>But I am still amazed.<br/><br/>I was duly informed, when I went for a ride<br/><br/>that there was a BREAK FAILURE<br/><br/>and the fuel gauge was more-or-less entirely based on guesswork<br/><br/>but it was the most comfortable, wonderful car ever.<br/><br/>I was so taken!</blockquote><br/>.<br/><blockquote><strong>91</strong><br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Saw a lady, walk she down the street.<br/><br/>Came across a water fountain,<br/><br/>Spraying up-straight up and down<br/><br/>Almost wetting her feet.<br/><br/>Quite clear block her path it did<br/><br/>She turned around quite troubled,<br/><br/>Behind her cutting a small fine hedge<br/><br/>A young man face covered with stubble.<br/><br/>And as my glassy big green bus<br/><br/>Sailed by the two<br/><br/>I remember the last I saw<br/><br/>Was that he had some gum to chew.</blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-3704276160104230585?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
