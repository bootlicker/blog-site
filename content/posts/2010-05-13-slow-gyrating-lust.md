<p>In the depths of my sleep, the little amount of sleep that I get, I'm visited by a blinding yellow-white light which consumes all neuroses.</p>&#13;
<p>I'll roll over and disturb my cat to my left, and on stormy nights like last night, I'll become surprised at the darkness and anger of the world outside by bedroom window.</p>
