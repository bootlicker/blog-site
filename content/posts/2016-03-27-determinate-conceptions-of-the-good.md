It seems to be common sense that if you think there is something concretely morally good or right to be done, you&#8217;re deluded, brainwashed, in short, irrational.

This is obviously a symptom of capitalism. Like Marx shows, capital empties out the content of the human way of life, and makes it almost perfectly formal and abstract. In this way <span class="text_exposed_show">the huge financialisation of capitalism is just as symptomatic of the same process as &#8220;not wanting to offend anyone&#8221;, &#8220;snowflake models of organisation&#8221;, and &#8220;horizontalism&#8221;.</span>

<div class="text_exposed_show">

    Alasdair Macintyre, in <em>After Virtue</em> reveals what the essential reality is behind this ideological appearance. The true content of our social existence as humans becomes emotivistic. That is, we treat ethical decisions like cheering on a football team. Casualisation of the workforce, &#8220;flexibility in the workplace&#8221;, &#8220;terrorists are destroying our way of life&#8221;, hurrah! We become objects for manipulation by brute force.

    The point is to get back to what it means to be human, what Marx said our &#8220;species-being&#8221; (a term from Feuerbach, sure, but he was right) was. The purpose of a human is to develop themselves as a creative and self-determining social agent. To realise their potential free from wage-slavery, gender oppression, and racism.
