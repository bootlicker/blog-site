<blockquote>"Where's your namebadge?"<br/><br/>"I don't have one."<br/><br/>"How long have you been working here?"<br/><br/>"A year."<br/><br/>"So you've been working here for a whole year without a namebadge. Tell me, is it our responsibility or your responsibility?"<br/><br/>"I.. I don't know."<br/><br/>"I think you do."<br/><br/>"Mine?"<br/><br/>"What's your name?<br/><br/>"Blair."<br/><br/>"Is LMNOP your line-manager?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Right. Thanks."</blockquote><br/><em>That's right. Make an enemy out of me. I don't even know your name, Mr. Head-honcho, I had to get someone else to tell me that you were the Regional Manager. I have so little respect for you for belittling me that I'm almost <span style="text-decoration:underline;">compelled</span> to leave your stupid company. You know, I've even heard XYZ is a big social retard, running away from everyone, disdainful of his fame. I'm tempted to say that it's not just this company that treats young workers like crap - it' really hard for young people to get jobs, let alone <span style="text-decoration:underline;">like</span> them. I'm fairly certain we get the dregs of what's offered; I'm absolutely filled with frustration every time I open up the paper and read what some ageist has said about young people being slovenly drunkards with no brain-matter.</em><br/><br/><em>Let me get this straight: Everyone is a totally different person, everyone is a totally different citizen of the world, and the very second you deny them manners, you've created a social caste. Justice is fairness, I feel like you're the reason why people start wars. I saw you bossing LMNOP as you walked down my aisle, and then stare at that woman's arse.</em><br/><br/><em>.</em><br/><blockquote><strong>The Chinese Room</strong><br/><br/>.<br/><br/>1950: the food was mushy<br/><br/>A crooner serenaded my exhaustion with a wailing string section.<br/><br/>The peeling interior roof-tiles<br/><br/>and the talking fish<br/><br/>symbolise your dementia.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Everyone stare at me when talking about that kid who got expelled.<br/><br/>Actually,<br/><br/>let's never leave the subject of newspaper articles.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>When I said no-one's ever accepted me into your family, I was dead right.</blockquote><br/>.<br/><br/>That wasn't even a damn poem but you kind of get the point.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-4233365910557823925?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
