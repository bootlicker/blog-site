From the looks of it, the competition closed in early April. There are a couple of stand-out homebrew titles here &#8211; the most prominent competition entry being [_DARC_][1], a jet-pack shooter. The author wasn&#8217;t able to finish the level design, but has finished the game&#8217;s engine.

Check out the entries [here][2].
