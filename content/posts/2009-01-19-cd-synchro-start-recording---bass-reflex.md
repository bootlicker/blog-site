I guess somewhere<br/><br/>A lot of bad blood went down<br/><br/>What am I trying to say<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Looking for the exits<br/><br/>Thinking about how quickly one should leave<br/><br/>Wondering where the car was<br/><br/>Finding quick explanations<br/><br/>Apologies<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Feeling sick<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Somewhere a lot of bad blood went down<br/><br/>I find myself repeating myself<br/><br/>myself<br/><br/>I just can't deal with the problem<br/><br/>This<br/><br/>That<br/><br/>Everything that surrounds me<br/><br/>Everything that did<br/><br/>Why the cliches<br/><br/>Words lots of other people have used<br/><br/>To fail to explain an overwhelming feeling<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Once told language was a barrier<br/><br/>That person doesn't want to talk to me anymore<br/><br/>I laugh<br/><br/>I don't really want to talk to me either<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>A lot of bad blood is going down<br/><br/>And I don't understand why so many people have gaunt faces<br/><br/>There was another<br/><br/>And I speak quite literally, this I can't really obscure<br/><br/>Closer to the front, just slightly<br/><br/>I remember his face so differently<br/><br/>Although I can recall how it was changing<br/><br/>That broke my heart<br/><br/>To see that gaunt mug<br/><br/>I don't accuse him of that<br/><br/>I hope dearly I'm entirely wrong<br/><br/>Maybe that's my problem obscuring his face<br/><br/>Wishing the problem to be his as well<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Something takes me through time when I sleep<br/><br/>Causes me to play CDs I did when I was twelve<br/><br/>I'll cause an earthquake and bury it all<br/><br/>I'll go down with the ship<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>I don't understand what I'm doing<br/><br/>I don't have the tools<br/><br/>I don't have the family<br/><br/>I just don't have enough inside me<br/><br/>What do I want for it<br/><br/>A rifle, a dove<br/><br/>A wet rubber hand<br/><br/>This is becoming too long<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>What do I want to say<br/><br/>I want this feeling to go away<br/><br/>And I want to take back all the sadness from everyone<br/><br/>I'll keep it all, I just want -<br/><br/>I want a lot of things<br/><br/>I'm fairly sure I'm a bad person<br/><br/>I'm getting closer to having someone telling me what I deserve<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-8399480932944170785?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
