Hello everyone! It has been quite a rollercoaster ride for me over the last month!

Please forgive me for not updating the blog during this period of time, I have migrated the blog from vultr.com to scaleway.com, where I now have the blog based on an ARM64-based VPS.

This means I now do not run any of my web presence on Intel x86 platforms anymore, which means the energy efficiency of my web presence is now much higher, and much more hardware secure.

This is very cool :-)
