Sven slept at his desk with a small light on, books open and blinds closed. He dreamt of lawnmovers mowing endless plains of grass, until his vibrating mobile phone finally woke him.<br/><br/>"Dude, everyone's going to the beach."<br/><br/>"Studying... I gotta - I gotta study."<br/><br/>"You sound half asleep, you always fall asleep when you study."<br/><br/>"Its not my fault that guy wrote Cloudstreet."<br/><br/>"I think you should come to the beach."<br/><br/>Canned laughter drifted over plates clattering downstairs.<br/><br/>"I don't like the beach."<br/><br/>"You like the beach. You've ran into the ocean fully dressed."<br/><br/>"That was different!"<br/><br/>"Five beers different?"<br/><br/>"I just don't want to go."<br/><br/>"You're so miserable."<br/><br/>A crackly sigh fizzed in Red's mobile-phone earpiece.<br/><br/>"Fine, I'll come."<br/><br/>"Nah, look, don't worry about it, you've gotta study, or whatever you've gotta do."<br/><br/>"No, fine, I'll come."<br/><br/>"No, look, don't come."<br/><br/>**<br/><br/>Does anyone else have these really pointless conversations in their head?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-4306503930079006137?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
