Liam has to go around and stop Alliance branches and other groups from mobilising.

He has different powers he can use against groups:

  * Ideological powers, advocating evolutionism
  * Physical force: bash up stalls
  * Bargaining powers: Liam does horrible union deals
  * Political powers: persuasion against political plans

Could be like a stealth game, breaking into branch meetings and getting on the speaking list.
