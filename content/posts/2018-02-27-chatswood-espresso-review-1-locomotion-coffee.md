Price: $3.50 for Double Espresso Dine-In

# First Impression

Very sweet. Quite sweet for espresso, and espresso is a very sweet coffee style. I think this would suit people who really detest acidic espresso.

# After Thoughts

It was very bold, and full-flavoured, and it didn&#8217;t give me acid reflux like some espressos do. This leads me to &#8220;gag&#8221; as I am drinking the coffee. This did not happen.

I really enjoy the aftertaste of espresso, and the taste of coffee didn&#8217;t really hang around for very long. That was disappointing.

The texture of the drink was just right, not too thick or watery &#8211; which is sometimes a problem.

Did it wake me up? Definitely. I was very alert after 10 minutes.

I don&#8217;t score in stars or numerical systems.

This is a solid choice for espresso as you jump off the train in Chatswood.

WOULD RECOMMEND.
