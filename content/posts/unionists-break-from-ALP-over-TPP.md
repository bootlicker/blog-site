The [announcement by the Australian Labor Party’s parliamentary caucus](https://cm.socialist-alliance.org/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=5544&qid=249143) that it will vote up the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP-11) has created a backlash, with the secretary of Hunter Workers (formerly the Newcastle Trades Hall Council) Daniel Wallace resigning from the party.

Wallace posted a copy of his resignation letter on Facebook on September 14, commenting: “My good deed for the day ... finally realised that the shortcuts taken by the ALP usually lead to detours which lead to dead ends.

“Still some good people left in Labor but I will leave them to fight from the inside for what they believe in and I will just stick to fighting for what I believe is in the best interest of workers.”

Speaking to Wallace on September 19, [he told Green Left Weekly](https://cm.socialist-alliance.org/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=5544&qid=249143) that since resigning he has received many messages of support from unionists.
