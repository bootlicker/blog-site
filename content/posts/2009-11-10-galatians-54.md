The sun had beat down on them for little over a month now, their headclothes had dissolved, what remained on their bodies was bleached and threadbare - the smell of the earth permeated through the core of their very minds, Harkoff, Shredig and Foolio trudged blindly into the southern Nelen suburbs of Lesser Jou.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>"Mister Minister?"<br/><br/>The old man put down some yellowing typewritten papers before grasping the secretary at his office door with a firm gaze. "Yes?"<br/><br/>"I've been authorised to inform you that dispatch team -"<br/><br/>"Contact Field-Marshall Sherpie and tell him to contact Ragzin."<br/><br/>"<em>Field-Marshall</em> Sherpie? And... and...

Concrete formed simple prisms that housed people closer and more numerously that ever before. It was both dually and simultaneouslyÂ  speedily dirty, and saturated with new Nelen culture. A new movement carried this espousal of functionalism forward, prioritising not a direct expression of wealth, but the pursual and possession of as much of it as physically possible.<br/><br/>Installation four was a relic of this era. Concrete lift-shafts, concrete access-shafts, concerete hallways. Totally underground, it was another secret government facility that had been converted from office-space to a site for scientific experiements.<br/><br/>[continued, was not going to post but it became enough]<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-5570352838016409334?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
