Spotify is terrible. It barely ever boots up properly, and frequently requires me to clear my phone&#8217;s RAM in order to make it work. Soundcloud never does this.

There are now all these enormous Silicon Valley companies, but can any of them actually make a platform, device, or product which is not bloated and slow?

I think I may just go back to using MP3s, because Spotify rarely ever works on my device anymore, despite the fact the program (I refuse to say &#8220;app&#8221;) is up to date.
