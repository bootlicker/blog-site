I absolutely love cassette tapes. I think they sound wonderful. They are so fun to make. Planning mixtapes and taking the time to make sure that they're made carefully is such an enjoyable process. 

One of the big problems about having cassette tapes as a hobby at the moment is that much of the easily accessible or affordable equipment is old and faulty. I have had a terrible time repairing tape decks. Much of the plastic components in their mechanisms are incredibly brittle, and very many of the strings required for, say, idler wheels, take-up mechanisms, etc, cannot maintain their tension.

So, one option I explored was _buying a new tape deck_. I am an Australian, so very many of these decks require a _step down transformer_ in order to operate. One of the great things about these decks is that they do not require conversion from 60Hz AC to 50Hz AC.

| Name               | Frequency Response             | Price                 |
|:------------------:|:------------------------------:|:---------------------:|
| Marantz PMD-330CP  | Chrome - 15KHz, Type 1 - 14KHz | AUD$197 + 80 Shipping |
| Panasonic RXD45    | 12KHz, Type 1 only             | AUD$166               |
| Panasonic RXD50-55 | 12KHz, Type 1 only             | AUD$195               |
| Sony CFD-S70       | 10KHz, Type 1 only, I think    | AUD$150               |
| Sony CFD-S401      | 10KHz, Type 1 only, I think    | AUD$253 + 88 Shipping |
| Toshiba TY-CDK8    | 75Hz-12KHz, Type 1 only        | AUD$270               |

Here are some options to think about if all you want to record is voice. These are very common New Old Stock, and New models that have a frequency response of around 6.3KHz to 8KHz.
