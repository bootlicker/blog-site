we massively wring our hands and fight among ourselves about how we still use 
monolithic kernels in UNIX land

but our kernel is so much fucking better than whatever windows has

so, so much better

i think it speaks to the incredible culture we have that we want something even 
better than we currently have, which is already so much better than anything 
else
