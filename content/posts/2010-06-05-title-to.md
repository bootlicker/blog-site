<p>I'll give you some priorities,</p>&#13;
<p>Set your shopping budget</p>&#13;
<p>Swear by your purse-strings</p>&#13;
<p>.</p>&#13;
<p>Your journal entries are a bolero</p>&#13;
<p>That you dance to:</p>&#13;
<p>Dance! little five cent piece.</p>&#13;
<p>.</p>&#13;
<p>I'm too tired all the time, andÂ I don't even remember what we argue about, I think we're just completely different people. I can't stand your no-nonsense attitude towards everything, and the way you say things. I don't know what you think, but its probably wrapped up in your construction of your own self worth. Let's just stay out of each other's faces, I'm going to disappear for a while.</p>
