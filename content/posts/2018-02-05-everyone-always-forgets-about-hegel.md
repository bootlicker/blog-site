We hear heaps about Heidegger, Deleuze, Badiou (less angry about you), Plato and Descartes&#8230; god forbid we always hear heaps about Hume in the academy.

But we always pass over Hegel. Hegel is where philosophy was completed! It&#8217;s where all the contradictions in modern thought were resolved and synthesised into a total system.

Analytic philosophy always stops at Kant and never advances any further. With Pippin and Pinkard and Brandom we have seen Hegel basically turned into a more extreme version of Kant. This is all nonsense.

Hegel is an Aristotelian at heart. The mythology of phenomenology completely passes over this &#8211; it goes Plato-Descartes-Phenomenology. It completely ignores Wolffian Rationalism, and it completely forgets the millenia of Aristotelianism.

This makes me very frustrated.
