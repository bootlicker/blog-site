This damn sword has eaten up so much money! I supremely hope that this foam and fibreglass sword I am making for my costume to wai.con turns out well, because it has costed almost half of the money I earned working last week. And I still have to buy the spray paint for it... And I'm fairly sure my clothing part of the costume hasn't been totally finished either, and is going to require lots of money to finish.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>I'm writing this here because I told it to two people and I'm feeling fairly embarassed.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Blair complains about not having a job, Blair then gets a job and wastes all the money. I just feel kind of useless. But I want wai.con to be heaps of fun... I don't know. I'll just make the sword and the damn cloak and see how it goes.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-571988891190151929?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
