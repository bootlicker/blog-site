Printing issues postponed the release, but fortunately that had no lasting effect on the popularity of the game.

A mix of Metroid and Mega Man, the game is&#8211;like its predecessor&#8211;brutally tough, but not wholly unfair. The original game was famous for its blind jumps and pixel-perfect shooting, and while these qualities are likely to have been carried over to the sequel, YouTube footage reveals that Battle Kid 2 certainly executes a demonstrably more developed and nuanced execution of the two games&#8217; core ideas.

Besides being a well thought-out and all-round intelligent game, the importance of Battle Kid 2 is that it is further evidence of the growing legitimacy of independently-developed video games. With people like Sivak sitting down with the intention of coding rewarding games with nothing but assembly language and low-level C, and people receptive and appreciative of such efforts, one can confidently say that the future of video games in good hands.
