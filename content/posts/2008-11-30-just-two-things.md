I've discovered Phantasy Star Universe and Final Fantasy X.<br/><br/>Its beautiful sitting in my room about this time. There's a feeble, orange-grey light coming through my window, making my desk half-invisible. There's something exciting about it! Try it, sit in your room after the sun has gone down, just after, and watch everything disappear.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-5415872116924566384?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
