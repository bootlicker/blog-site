<p>This is some of my worst writing because the two characters just talk straight past each other, and because of that you can easily detect that I'm trying to write about something else.</p>&#13;
<p>I'm cutting the above passage out of the book, or at least splitting its content into other parts of the story.</p>&#13;

<p>Sherpy risked a furtive glance at Humphries dabbing her eyes with her gloves.</p>&#13;
<p>"Is - is everything all right?"</p>&#13;
