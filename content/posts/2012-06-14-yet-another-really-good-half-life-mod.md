This mod has copped a bit of criticism for still being a little &#8216;unpolished&#8217;, but from what I&#8217;ve seen of [Cry of Fear][1], not only is the Half-Life engine still freaking awesome, but it goes to show that you don&#8217;t have to be a huge-arse game corporation to develop an incredibly immersive and engaging video game.

I might go and pull up a list of good Half-Life mods that have been handed down throughout the ages.
