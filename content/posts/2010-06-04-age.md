<p>I can see your age, not in your face or in your clothes, but in your eyes and your attitude: the way you sit, the way you look directly at a person when you talk to them, the way you make direct answers to questions, and the way you correct people's speech.</p>&#13;
<p>This is how I knew you were older.</p>
