_**From Simon to Blair:**_

I'm trying to figure out the whole problem at the heart of the entire
philosophical discussion of Marx's Capital --> the relation between
capital's forms and 'abstraction'.

Mainly by trying to work what I think are the three best readings of
Capital / Grundrisse: Lukacs' History & Class Consciousness, Althusser &
co's Reading Capital, and Negri's Marx beyond Marx; combined with a
Badiouian take on abstraction (which I think is Hegelian in the precise
sense that D-lo used to associate with lukacs - abstraction as not
isolating a single element, but appreciating a multiplicity of
determinations)

You might be interested in a very high end article on abstraction by a
Badiou-inspired philosopher engaging with accelerationism:
http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/wandering-abstraction

But basically what I'm trying to answer is: how can we theorise capital as
pure forms (the syllogisms), while still managing to account for the way
capitalism changes itself? And not just in a constant ever-revolutionising
sense -- slowly adding new technology, greater masses of constant capital,
increasing divisions of labour and complexity -- but in a *qualitative* sense
with the development of news forms of *abstraction* within capital's forms
itself. Most importantly, the twin developments of a qualitatively new
inclusion of abstraction within post-70s capitalism: the rise of
abstraction, or logical thought, being a key aspect of service labour after
the demise of factory labour (and taylorisation, the exclusion of
autonomous mental thought from the workers body through its mechanical
measurement); and the rise of financialisation whereby the inner workings
and measurements of capital itself are determined by share-holder led
financial evaluations: self-audits, constant profitability (not just long
term, but short term dividends delivered regularly to share holders), and
the variety of financial innovations (mathematical tools like derivatives
and securitisation) that increasingly form core components of corporate
strategies. And of course crossing both these forms of increasingly
dominant forms of abstraction (cognitive labour and financial calculation)
is the rise of information / communication technology that extend our
ability to abstractly think, as technologies which operate upon
mathematical principles (vital to both modern service work and the modern
financial sector -- think what would the stock market be without computers
& networks).

So appreciating this qualitative shift within capital itself, which can be
isolated as *three* forms (only two mentioned above): the new forms of
service labour that incorporate abstraction within the workers activity
itself, the new forms of money now that it is no longer attached to any
sort of gold standard but whose value is determined through both the market
in currencies, as well as derivatives (which contingently fix the exchange
rate in advance in order to reduce uncertainty & risk), and finally the
corporate form itself which has progressively shifted from the private
firm, to the joint-stock company (the corporation, which Marx mentions in
Capital III as the socialisation of capital within capitalism), and finally
the share-holder led multinational corporation which arose after the 1970s.

Notably Hardt & Negri describe all three forms in their latest book
Assembly, but don't do an adequate job theorising this correspondence of
this new stage of abstraction within capitalism -- a problem which can be
traced back to Negri's reading of the Grundrisse in the 1970s. But the idea
he proposed in the book is still important -- that workers struggle itself
is what drives the transformations of capital and its internal categories
(labour, money, productive capital) -- rather than capital slowly
'perfecting' itself or unfolding its concept or some other lukacs-inspired
interpretation what can't appreciate qualitative breaks within abstraction.

Anyway, on abstraction itself, I've always felt a bit unconvinced by the
arguments of Sohn Rethel (not that I've read him) that the key to replacing
the 'idealist' conception of abstraction as simply the ideality of thought
(like when something is called 'just abstract' as opposed to concrete,
real, material) with an appreciation of the way capital operates as a 'real
abstraction', an abstraction that operates without peoples awareness (hence
the way D-lo connects it to reification) because of capital's automatic
self-reproducing forms, which comes prior to the emergence of abstraction
within human thought. Although I think this opens up the vital issue of the
role of abstraction in a non-idealist form in Capital, it's always struck
me as a simple flipping of the idealist schema. 'Real abstraction' still
comes across as something that sinisterly places singular elements (like
labour-time, money as measure) over humans, who must then abolish this
abstraction and return to concreteness -- this is certainly the argument
D-lo has advanced in the past. Plus he doesn't account for *how* capital
effects this 'real abstraction' -- usually approaching it at the level of
simple exchange, where to buy or sell something means to treat that
commodity 'abstractly' as a single value / price, thus reducing the labour
that went into it into a homogenous standard ('abstract labour'). Again,
this clearly gets at something important, but strikes me as philosophically
a bit naive, still opposing in romantic fashion labour or essence against
the evil abstraction that measures it.

Badiou on the other hand I think repeats Hegel by offering a different
account of abstraction entirely, not the one that Hegel would consider as
the common sense abstraction of the Understanding (reducing a multiplicity
of elements to a single element which unites them -- like 'abstract labour'
or concepts which subsume their objects). Roughly put, because I still
don't entirely understand Badiou, abstraction is then a 'singular'
operation --> it operates upon its raw material in order to produce a
different configuration of knowledge; rather than simply imposing on a raw
material an abstract unity from above (hence Kant's transcendental subject
plugs the hole in this logical antinomy).

I guess the key thing to problematise in the way Capital is interpreted
with the naive approach to abstraction (lukacs & sohn rethel, possibly
Althusser) is to highlight the role 'reproduction' has within these
theories. Both Lukacs & Althusser essentially see the 'reproduction' of
capital (of its forms -- such as the stability of money/currency, or the
company/corporate form of productive capital) as an essentially automatic
or entirely self-produced process, basically a static universal which you
can't theorise internal change with (except as gradual perfecting of its
form, or purification). I think the inability to think the relation of
abstraction (what produces the measurement of 'abstract labour'?) in both
these approaches highlights the inadequate philosophical approach of both
lukacs and althusser. Hence why I think Badiou -- whose whole project
consists in overcoming the division humanism (sartre for him) and
structuralism (althusser, lacan) -- is the guy who can better theorise
abstraction. Especially as his views on logic / abstraction evolves in an
important critique he makes of Jacques Alain Miller's attempt to provide a
lacanian theory of logic in the 1960s, the guy who coined 'metonymic
causality' which becomes a crucial concept in Althusser's Reading Capital.

Anyway, there's more to be said but this was longer than I thought, so I'll
just send it now and give my head a break! Lemme know what you think so
far, if you have any criticisms or comments to add, directions that might
be useful etc!

_**Blair's Reply to Simon:**_

Okay! A lot of the stuff on how abstraction and concreteness works is a lot 
more solid for me, I think. You should take a look at Fred Besier's monogram 
/Hegel/ from 2005, I think.

ALSO. I have a book on Aristotle's logic which deals with his four forms of 
causation, (material, efficient, formal, and final), and there is an extended 
discussion on how Aristotle considered non-sentient/sapient things to have
final causes. Basically modernity is constantly wrapped up with the problem of 
'only sapient things can have concepts/formal-final causes, because only 
sapient things have intentions'. I think if we unlink intentionality from
formal-final causation, then the issue of how abstraction works is basically 
solved.

The kind of materialism we need therefore needs to be a lot closer to Spinoza's 
pantheism--although I maintain my system of how the universe is permeated with 
concepts even if humans didn't exist (my supervisor said this
'baffled' him) if absolutely atheist and has nothing to do with God.

Have you read my article on Marx and Feenberg? I talk about how materialism has 
been wrongly understood to mean a purely efficiently-caused universe. Anyway 
here is the link:
(https://bootlicker.party/posts/marx-naturalism-and-the-disenchantment-of-nature
/)

For me we have been too obsessed with the Understanding. And focusing too much 
on how bourgeois economists or bourgeois philosophers deal with concepts leads 
to this idea that concrete universals/perfectly mediated abstractions
is a difficult issue.

I have an article which spells this out. I'll attach it. It's by a scholar 
named Franz Knappik, and it talks about how Hegel's science of logic is a kind 
of 'natural kind essentialism'. That is, every entity in the universal is
natural, and it is also an essence/a bundle of properties. The idea that 
everything is a little monad which is trying to develop itself into the most 
perfect conception of the Absolute Idea is /my/ brand of materialism. This
manages to explain what abstraction and concreteness is, because only the most 
self-reflexive and self-determining entities are the most concrete -- only 
those entities which are able to go through 'absolute negation'.

So the question *I* ask myself when I think about how pernicious capitalism has 
become is how have humans become /less/ reflexive, or /less/ interdependent in 
a transparent way. Then you start looking for /material/ or
/efficient/ causes, not formal ones. So for /me/, the issue of how to 
characterise the formal-final essence of capitalism comes from its /material/ 
effects. And those material effects are to be enumerated in terms of 'moral
damage', or 'moral demerits', how the human essence or human moral character 
has become damaged by the system.

Does this make sense?

I also tend not to think of capitalism as a system which integrates us all and 
binds us all together invisibly, as if it was some sort of inisible magic 
force. I think capitalism is something which is /consciously perpetuated/,
and the level of habituation occurs at the level of leaders, and not at the 
level of workers. I am definitely more of an instrumentalist than say Negri and 
Hardt. I don't think worker's resistance or worker's
development/struggle/organisation is something which is coopted by the system 
-- it is something which is consciously and actively crushed. You can see that 
by say working at a call centre.

Control is still naked and one-dimensional for me.

I think we still share a lot of ideas in common, though!

_**Simon's Second Email to Blair:**_

Basically, following Negri but without his Deleuzian vitalism (using Badiou
instead -- Hegel > post-structuralist vitalism), I'm trying to figure out
how workers struggle itself can drive capital to adopt increasing levels of
abstraction itself --> how is this possible, what are the mechanism that
shift capital from one level of abstraction to another (industrial to
service work, fixed money to floating, large fordist corporations to the
frantic restructuring (flexibility, outsourcing, downsizing) imposed by the
rise of the contemporary stock market (which itself is what destabilises
the fixed form of money -- as increased capital flows between countries in
the 60s is what made the post-WWII gold standard system of internally money
(tying currencies to the US dollar, which itself was pegged to the value of
gold) untenable, and hence its replacement by floating currencies)) (sorry
for the triple bracketing ahaha).
Put another way... what makes capital 'porose to the event', able to
respond to class struggle which destabilises capitalist hegemony by not
simply restructuring itself, but incorporate the very ideas and energies of
revolt into a new configuration of production-consumption? As you can tell,
I'm trying to mash Badiou and Negri together here...

_**Blair's Second Reply to Simon:**_

Hmm...

Well I think you need to read this book I am reading. It is about imperialism 
in the 21st century.

What I would say at this point is that it may /look/ like capitalism has 
coopted or ascended into higher levels of abstraction in the /centre/ of the 
imperialist system, but ultimately this is not even where most of the value
production is being done in this day and age.

Basically every single measure of productivity and profit-making of all of the 
biggest corporations on Earth is a lie. All the value comes from sectors 
outside the centre of Imperialism, and this is all fudged on the books to
make it look like the centre of Imperialism is what is generating the 
productivity. This is of course a massive fudge a complete lie, and I think 
this misinformation actually informs a lot of the research into the services
sector or the 'knowledge economy' in the West. If you are duped by the lie, the 
idea that the 'knowledge economy' is actually productive (it is not), then it 
/looks/ like capitalism has ascended into a more pernicious and
abstract and coopting beast.

But the truth is all the highest rates of exploitation are outside the West, 
and all that productivity is fudged on the books and made to look as if it 
originates from INISDE the West, when it fact it doesn't at all.

So I obviously find autonomism and Negri's work insanely useful, but I actually 
think he is overcomplicating the problem. The level of abstraction that 
capitalism normally needs in order to function hasn't changed much since the
1970s, I think. I in fact think a lot of the work that the New Left did before 
post-structuralism (all the humanist stuff) is actually still really important 
and relevant.

I really need to pirate this book. I can't find any copies of it anywhere. It 
would be really important to make it free and accessible.

What do you think?

I guess for me capitalism is very much a one or two dimensional system, not a 
multi-dimensional one like you.. seem?.. to think?

Hmm..

Anyway this is what I think!
