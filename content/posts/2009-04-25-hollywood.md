Yes. Christian. Yes. Julia Stone <em>did</em> sing this one, and I <em>do</em> like it.<br/><br/>.<br/><blockquote>They all would have been killed<br/>In the sound of music<br/><br/>They would have found out that<br/>Pinocchio could never tell the truth<br/><br/>She never would have made it to shore<br/>The little mermaid. He would have married a whore<br/>From a wealthy family, after all he wasn't royalty<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I blame you Hollywood<br/>For showing me things you never should<br/>Show a young girl<br/>In this cruel world</blockquote><br/><h6>She still sounds like an effing four-year-old.</h6><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-5102696236501060713?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
