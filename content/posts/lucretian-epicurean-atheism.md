Lucretian and Epicurean Atheism
From Wikipedia:

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_rerum_natura#Background)

>To the Greek philosopher Epicurus, the unhappiness and degradation of
>humans arose largely from the dread which they entertained of the
>power of the deities, from terror of their wrath. This wrath was
>supposed to be displayed by the misfortunes inflicted in this life
>and by the everlasting tortures that were the lot of the guilty in a
>future state (or, where these feelings were not strongly developed,
>from a vague dread of gloom and misery after death). Epicurus thus
>made it his mission to remove these fears, and thus to establish
>tranquility in the minds of his readers. To do this, Epicurus invoked
>the atomism of Democritus to demonstrate that the material universe
>was formed not by a Supreme Being, but by the mixing of elemental
>particles that had existed from all eternity governed by certain
>simple laws. He argued that the deities (whose existence he did not
>deny) lived forevermore in the enjoyment of absolute peace—strangers
>to all the passions, desires, and fears, which affect humans—and
>totally indifferent to the world and its inhabitants, unmoved alike
>by their virtues and their crimes. This meant that humans had nothing
>to fear from them.

So, Epicurus, while still being a philosopher without a
fully-developed atheism and materialism, is a really good foundation
for a philosophy that /is/.

Definitely a thinker who took an important first step, in Western
philosophy, away from believing in supernatural entities and
processes.
