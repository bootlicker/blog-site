In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.
