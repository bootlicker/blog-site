I don't think 'i have nothing to hide' and 'mainstream metadata harvesting is 
not targeting/going to harm me' are arguments with any validity.

Neither are 'everyone uses mainstream social media, and I won't be in the loop', 
or 'the metadata collected about me aids me, and knows me well', or, especially 
in the case of activists: 'we need to go where the masses are' (virtually the 
same argument as: 'we should publish all our material in a Rupert Murdoch 
newspaper'

when I spend some time explaining movies like Facebookistan and books like The 
Twittering Machine, people I talk to quite often turn to fatalism and moral 
relativism in order to answer my arguments: 'there has always been 
surveillance', 'you believe in a utopia, there isn't a single right way for 
everyone'

there has also been some bizarre arguments levelled against me that Facebook is 
easily accessible to disabled people, therefore I am an ableist by saying they 
shouldn't use it...

The doublethink and doublespeak around mainstream social media is really 
worrying. I suppose I keep talking to people to whom the system is treating 
kindly, and that don't seem to worry about how things are going to turn out for 
them
