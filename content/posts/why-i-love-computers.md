I have no rational explanation for why I love, and have always loved computers

I remember picking up some commodore 64 BASIC listings in the late 90s and being 
incensed: "this is for me!!"

I am glad I waited until now to do a computer science degree, on the cusp of 
turning 30, because things are looking really really interesting in the 
computing world, for the first time in a long time.

Don't get me wrong, my multiple degrees in the humanities were lovely, though. I 
still have that as a big passion. If it wasn't for my education in philosophy I 
do not think I would be as good at programming as I am right now, even if I am 
just an 'expert beginner'
