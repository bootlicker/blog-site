This song lumbers along, I just love living elsewhere when I turn off and just walk around to and from the park in Jordan's thongs. I need better social skills.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Light globes wash up, all along the beach.<br/>And they light me up with, and they light me up with certainty.<br/>Well she calculates, coincidence, and circumstance and turbulence.<br/>Gotta see what it is, and it's everything, and it's endless.<br/><br/>'Cause baby can't see through, all this matter and makeup and déjà vu.<br/>Yeah we drift here alone, with nothing to do.<br/>Until one of us makes the other one come true.<br/><br/>She wants to meet her fate, but travel by free will.<br/>But you can't have both and you can't stand still, still, still.<br/>I'd be the luckiest man in the universe, if cause and effect doesn't get there first.<br/>But she, keeps looking for patterns, and the world just happens.<br/><br/>'Cause baby can't see through, all this matter and makeup and déjà vu.<br/>Yeah we drift here alone, with nothing to do.<br/>Until one of us makes the other one come true.<br/>Yeah one of us makes the other one come true.<br/><br/>Yeah 'cause baby can't see through,<br/>through all this matter and makeup and déjà vu.<br/>Yeah we drift here alone, we drift here alone.<br/>Yeah we drift here alone, we drift here alone.<br/>Yeah we drift here alone, with nothin' to do.<br/>Until one of us makes the other one come true.<br/>Yeah one of us makes the other one come true.<br/>She said these questions don't answer like other questions do.<br/>So just let me be here with you.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-3109884643398145571?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
