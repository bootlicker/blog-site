I have a lot of project ideas. I&#8217;ve been coming up with them faster than I can write them down. I&#8217;m sitting here at the bus stop with 10 minutes to kill, so I figured I&#8217;d finally make the time to write all these things down.

Some of these ideas are simple, and may only take a couple months to finish, whereas some projects may take a very very long time to achieve. Here we go:

  * Develop a philosophy of practical computing. Simple, repairable computers that do not spy, are built with open hardware, and are easy to understand and repair. You do not need a lot of transistors to do word processing, for instance. Usenet and Bulletin Board Systems are sufficient for most social communication. The World Wide Web and HTTP are terrible.
  * Develop a practical 8 or 16 bit computer that is useful and easy to repair.
  * Make a Commane Line Interface mobile phone.
  * Investigate how to make your own internet network (Satellite? HAM radio? Some other radio spectrum? Use the voice mobile phone network and use audio and encrypt?)
  * Contribute to the GNU search/construction of a micro kernel.
  * Buy a Commodore 64, or similar 8 bit computer, and refurbish
  * Develop own C64 software compatible micro computer out of TTL chips
  * Develop discrete transistor computer
  * Set up computer recycling service
  * Learn Ada
  * Develop a new NNTP program with all the modern security trappings
  * Learn about jobd
  * If not possible to make C64 hardware compatible TTL chip computer, write an emulator for it
  * Learn how to fabricate my own integrated circuits
  * Manufacture my own transistors
  * Finish my PhD
  * Get a job as an academic
  * Get a car
  * Relearn Japanese, and learn Spanish and Mandarin
  * Finish my Atari 2600 game
  * Buy the Shadowrun Core Rulebook
  * Build my own laptop with a Single Board Computer
  * Finish my Distraction Free Writing Machine project
  * Build a relay computer, and program it to play Noughts and Crosses, maybe other games
  * Finish learning about transistor amplifiers
  * Build a RISC V CPU with an FPGA
  * Investigate that project that runs BSD on a PIC microcontroller
  * Buy a mechanical keyboard
  * Buy a CRT monitor
  * Write up how to substantially get a KDE install of arch linux working (sound card, networking, USB permissions)

That is all I can think of!
