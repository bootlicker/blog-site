<p>I walked out of the house, closed and locked the front door, and walked a part way down the street. It was about then that I realised that I'd left the oven on. It was a hot day, and the sun's heat was already insufferable, and this made the trip back to the house and into the smoking kitchen that much more frustrating.</p>&#13;
<p>The phone began to ring as I was fanning the screaming smoke-detector with a newspaper, and by that time I was already so hot and exasperated that I went straight to the phone.</p>&#13;
<p>"Yes."</p>&#13;
<p>"Hello?"</p>&#13;
<p>"Yes, who is it?"</p>&#13;
<p>"I can't hear you, there's some alarm goin-"</p>&#13;
<p>"Yes it's the smoke alarm, what is it?"</p>
