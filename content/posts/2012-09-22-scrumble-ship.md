A recent indie game bundle [sale][1]Â (where you contribute whatever amount of economic value you see fit) put me onto quite an interesting indie project called [Scrumble Ship][2]. The idea behind the game is that it simulates the most realistic space combat possible. It has a kickstarter profile [here][3], and a facebook profile [here][4].

The concept is intriguing! For most purposes it seems like Minecraft set in space, but perhaps it could make use of some Star Trek-esque mechanics?
