To Thesaurus.com,

Hello, I absolutely love your thesaurus.com website, and I would love to find out how to work for you.

I would just love to work with words and discover new links and definitions -- especially with how language has changed.

I am a Philosophy PhD candidate at Notre Dame University, Australia.

Who can I send a cover letter and CV to?

Sincerely,

Blair.
