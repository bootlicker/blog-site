The Iwata Asks series is a brilliant idea! The interview President Iwata conducts with the developers and designers of the now-ancient Game & Watch series reveals the kind of environment that contributes to making truly great video games. Unconcerned with sales figures, the designers of the G&W games all took turns programming and constructing the games, and designing the game concepts. The sheer limitations of the G&W platform&#8211;a mere converted calculator&#8211;were far from something that hindered its capacity to foster creativity, it provided a framework through which _fifty-nine_ games were made!

Iwata makes a point of this, commenting that the sheer difficulty of _testing_ the operation of the game (having to physically _make_ the game area with a piece of photo-sensitive film) _contributed_ to the creativity of the platform&#8217;s development: their (what I can only assume to be) supervisor, Yokoi-san, would regularly send the designers back to _remake_ a game to introduce difficult elements! The fact that the development team went to a department store to help promote the games might be a bit of exaggerated nostalgia, but it certainly highlights something important that has been lost by the games industry today &#8211; focus on making games an art, and not a commodity.

The Iwata asks series really is a great way to explore game theory and development, I&#8217;m immensely glad Nintendo went and did it.
