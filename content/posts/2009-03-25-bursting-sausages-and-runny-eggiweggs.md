I remember having tantrums at the age of twelve, looking at the prices of these things. Maybe it's the music.<br/><br/>I remember all my muscles locking up, arms contorted, legs dove-toed. Knees helping me do this funny dance. It's serious. Everyone can hear, everyone's looking, this is being told to my grandparents. I'm a nancy boy, that's what this is. This is because I'm spoilt.<br/><br/>All the blood I owned going to my head, water in my nose, water in my eyes, running into my mouth. I'm now panting and screaming, face wet and ruddy.<br/><br/>BUT. BUT. BUT. BUT. I WANT IT.YOU SAID. PLEASE. I JUST. I. I. I. I. W-W-WAN - MA-MA-MUM<br/><br/>How old am I now? I don't know how old I am. All this is in my head now, I just stop talking and start running when something's not what I want.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>I wrote these during the week. They're about different things. I feel like I have to introduce them a bit now, I won't be doing this again, introducing things is stupid. Introducing people is important. Because once you've been introduced they can rip you off.<br/><br/>.<br/><blockquote><strong>You Sound Like</strong><br/><br/>.<br/><br/>What do you think<br/><br/>What is inside there<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>This is what I have to know<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Square pegs in round holes, everyone.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Because I'm out of my depth,<br/><br/>again,<br/><br/>When you're like me<br/><br/>And you can only pick up the kitchen-scraps<br/><br/>And wade through deep fogs, your voice echoing<br/><br/>And smell what could just be a hallucination<br/><br/>You'd be pleased to know what the secret is.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>I'm only responsible for me,<br/><br/>and the emotions of a million other people<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>And when I said no,<br/><br/>I did it with the least emotion and care I'd ever used in my life<br/><br/>There's a control panel somewhere<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Famous last words</blockquote><br/>.<br/><blockquote><strong>For Z</strong><br/><br/>.<br/><br/>The liars<br/><br/>The liars are the ones who smile so<br/><br/>And become different people<br/><br/>I'll be me<br/><br/>I left a beer bottle on your stairs<br/><br/>If your mother came home<br/><br/>that night and killed herself walking up them<br/><br/>I'd turn myself in</blockquote><br/>.<br/><blockquote><strong>A lady on the mobile phone, as I left the train, my face in a book:</strong><br/><br/>.<br/><br/>FUCKING HELL JOEL<br/>THE FOOD ISN'T FOR ME<br/><br/>I'M NOT GOING TO BE EATING<br/><br/>IT'S FOR YOU!<br/><br/>GO AND GET THE FUCKING FOOD JOEL.<br/><br/>FUCKING HELL JOEL.</blockquote><br/>.<br/><br/>You know I'm starting to miss a lot of people I still talk to a lot.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-4735853615585287294?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
