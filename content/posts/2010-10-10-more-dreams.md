<p>Sven was sat down on the old couch - I'm sure its since been replaced - and Red's old uncle began to speak.</p>&#13;
<p>"You know the hospital?"</p>&#13;
<p>"Yes."</p>&#13;
<p>"They're all walking through the hospital rooms."</p>&#13;
<p>"Who?"</p>&#13;
<p>"I can't rest, they're always walking and laughing through the passages, boy - I wish they wouldn't."</p>&#13;
<p>Sven stared, speechless, while the man's face became that of someone else. The room began to spin violently, and became very dark. The old uncle's face reappeared out of the insane darkness with its pointy nose, the itchy couch Sven was sitting on disappearing, Sven just falling, falling, falling.</p>
