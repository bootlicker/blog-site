it started to rain. (5)
i felt so elated (6)
.
the sound of droplets (5)
on the roof lifted me (6)
.
the overcast sky
radiated great joy
.
i felt as if there
was a deep connection
-
between me and the
land of the gadigal
.
there must be special
significance to this
-
season. the air is
fresh. the world seems reborn
