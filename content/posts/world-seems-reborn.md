it started to rain. (5) <br>
i felt so elated (6)<br>
.<br>
the sound of droplets (5) <br>
on the roof lifted me (6)<br>
.<br>
the overcast sky<br>
radiated great joy<br>
.<br>
i felt as if there<br>
was a deep connection<br>
<br>
between me and the<br>
land of the gadigal<br>
.<br>
there must be special<br>
significance to this<br>
<br>
season. the air is<br>
fresh. the world seems reborn<br>
