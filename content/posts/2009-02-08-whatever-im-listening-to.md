<blockquote><strong>Won't Worry My Away</strong><br/><br/>I'm going to make a concrete box<br/><br/>And bury everything I own<br/><br/>In a deep, deep hole<br/><br/>Where it's wet,<br/><br/>Where the light isn't shown<br/><br/>And after everything<br/><br/>In goes me<br/><br/>Outside will be locks<br/><br/>I'm fairly sure it will be heavy<br/><br/>And I think I will be happy.</blockquote><br/>.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to be morbid or anything, but I've got this picture in my head.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>The stereo on nextdoor was blaring pretty loudly, so I guess the person didn't really expect me standing on the chair.
