For a game with such simple concepts, its popularity has, ironically, rendered it prohibitively difficult to access in order to play. If you, like many others, are stuck in this predicament, worry no more, because a reasonably inexpensive equivalent exists which harbours just as much artistic quality.

The name of this title is _Atomic Runner_, outside of Japan. Originally an arcade game, its transition to the Sega _Mega Drive_ saw it undergo a host of changes both in form and in substance. Both _Atomic Runner_&#8216;s game-play and plot were altered (supposedly for the startling similarity that the original Japanese arcade game bore to the Chernobyl nuclear-reactor meltdown), but this rendered it a far superior game according to the critics (Sega-16 [review][2] and [forum discussion][3], [GameFAQ review][4], [Krooze&#8217;s Haunt][5]).

Against many run-and-gun games (and indeed many shoot&#8217;em ups) _AR _really does hold its own. The myriad of power-ups and environments through which to peruse are interesting, and the overall theme of the game, a synthesis of ancient cultures and ultra-modern technology, is well-executed.

It&#8217;s both an opportunity and a shame that this game has been overlooked, because its developer, Data East hasn&#8217;t really been remembered for any of its [fun and imaginative games][7]. I might return to Data East and go through its history.

Because the game is so short, Data East correspondingly made the obvious decision to crank up the game&#8217;s difficulty a fair amount. This shouldn&#8217;t surprise anyone, though. This was a fairly frequent design formula for many developers, as computer memory and system processing limitations virtually _bound_ them to making short, difficult games.
