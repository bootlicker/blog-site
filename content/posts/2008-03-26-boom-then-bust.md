That's the way it goes folks! That's the way life is. You'll never be able to conserve any emotion because it will be used up too quickly and you'll be busted.<br/><br/>I was suddenly a bit relieved, but now I'm more anxious. My MSN plays up a lot, so if you ever become frustrated with my despondency, it's not because I'm ignoring you and pursuing something pointless or something I think is interesting (which is possibly a tautology).<br/><br/>I don't think I can really trust anyone for too long. That's kind of scary.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-3151018880134106934?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
