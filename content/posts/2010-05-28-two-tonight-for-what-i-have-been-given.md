<p>Thank you very much for your attention</p>&#13;
<p>I will warm to the premise quite soon</p>&#13;
<p>Won't soon forget the short conversation</p>&#13;
<p>In between movements and relived at noon</p>&#13;
<p>.</p>&#13;
<p>I cannot remember feeling this safe</p>&#13;
<p>I've been the deliverer of anger</p>&#13;
<p>There's always been a careful wit to strafe</p>&#13;
<p>I'm a awful person, a warmonger</p>&#13;
<p>.</p>&#13;
<p>I haven't time to write the third stanza</p>&#13;
<p>You'll've two and a couplet to laugh at-a</p>
