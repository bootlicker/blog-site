<p>"I dunno man," Sven changed the way he sat on the kurb. "I just think everything that I wanted to happen to me has already happened."</p>&#13;
<p>"What? Do you want to die or something?"</p>&#13;
<p>"I guess - I wouldn't want it to be painful or anything, though. I guess I don't so much fear death as pain. I'd want it to be painless."</p>&#13;
<p>Red stared at the sun. "I just don't... I don't get it."</p>&#13;
<p>"There's just no purpose for me. I don't feel any strong calling apart from wanting to eat or piss, I think I've just become really transient and passive. I have all these memories that are like my closest and most trusted relatives and they keep me from being alone too much when you and I don't hang out for a while. I don't feel like I particularly want to do anything in the future, and I probably won't do nothing because that way I won't be able to eat, so I'll probably just try and get a job that lets me live it all out without too much fuss."</p>&#13;
<p>"Whatever man."</p>
