Men armed with aged weapons knelt a considerable distance from a masked target tied to a post.<br/>The idea behind all of this is pretty bizarre. Turns out that the man tied to the post is going to be shot, because he did something that the men with the weapons believe is wrong.<br/>	That’s what people do, y’know.<br/>	Well. That’s not the only way to kill a man, or many men, or women. Its not limited to gender, age or – this other concept – race. Some men or women kill other men or women because they believe that they’ll be better off.<br/><br/>	A clarification: Kill is a verb. A person or animal lives, then something kills them, and then they are dead.<br/><br/>	Another clarification: Dead is the opposite of alive.<br/><br/>	Further clarification: Alive is what you are.<br/>	<br/>	In this case, these men are going to kill an enemy man with rifles. Rifles shoot bullets, little metal things that go into a person’s body, which injures them. If you shoot a bullet into someone in the right place, or if you shoot a great amount of bullets at a person, they will die, and you would have killed them.<br/><br/>	How a rifle works: Rifles are made of lots of parts. First, there is the trigger. You pull or squeeze this to make the rifle work, and shoot a bullet – or in certain types of rifles, shoot lots of bullets, depending on how long you squeeze or pull the trigger. The next important part of a rifle is its barrel. The bullet travels down this, and spins as it rubs against the spiralled grooves it encounters along its journey. The magazine is where the bullets are stored, where they wait for the trigger to call them to start their journey.<br/>	<br/>	Rifles help you win. The idea of a war is to win. When a war starts, you give rifles to special men (and sometimes women, but not as many for some reason) called soldiers, and they shoot at the enemy, and the enemy will die, and when there is no more enemies left, you win the war.<br/>	The problem is that wars get very tricky very quickly. Enemies sometimes have rifles, and they sometimes shoot back. They also want to win, but they want you to lose.<br/><br/>	Losing is bad, apparently.<br/><br/>	So just remember: If you’re a soldier in a war, you want to win.<br/><br/>	Anyway, back to these men. They’re not in a war, but they are soldiers, and they want to win. They’re wearing special clothes called uniforms. When soldiers see other soldiers wearing the same special clothes as them, they know that those soldiers want to win the same thing that they do – so they make a group called an army or a faction or they call themselves all a name.<br/><br/>	Because that’s what you do.<br/><br/>	Soldiers wear uniforms, and carry rifles – because they want to win, and tell each other apart.<br/><br/>	Enemies don’t wear the same special clothes as their enemy. They need to know who the enemy is, so they can shoot them and win.<br/><br/>	But as we know – wars get tricky. Sometimes these rules aren’t followed.<br/>	The man who can’t see or move is going to be shot by lots of rifles, so that the army or faction or group can feel better, knowing that this man can’t stop them from winning.<br/>	Soldiers do what they are told.<br/><br/>	Because that’s what they do.<br/><br/>	They listen to what other men (and sometimes women, but not as often for some reason) say, and because they want to win the same thing as those men, they shoot rifles to help win.<br/>	Special men, who might not be soldiers, have power over soldiers, or other people. Those men are called leaders. Leaders are sometimes picked by people that like them, or sometimes become leaders because they kill people that they think will stop them from winning leadership.<br/><br/>	An apology: Leadership is a hard word.<br/>	<br/>	Sometimes leaders have power over other leaders. Power means that special men who don’t have as many listeners listen to someone who has more. (More of a good thing is good.)<br/><br/>	Power helps you win what you want.<br/><br/>	If an enemy has more power than another, they will win more.<br/><br/>...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-2452642230212024841?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
