My supervisor keeps making fun of me for wearing non-practical hats like berets, so I can going to make a game called &#8220;Richard the Scab&#8221;.

The point will be to break through a picket line and do work at a university while a strike is on. More to follow. I think the game should be pretty simple. You just have to avoid moving blocks of obstacles in order to get to the top of the screen. The final boss battle will be against a giant beret.
