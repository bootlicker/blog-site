~The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism – that of
Feuerbach included – is that the thing, reality, sensuousness, is
conceived only in the form of the object or of contemplation, but not
as sensuous human activity, practice, not subjectively. Hence, in
contradistinction to materialism, the active side was developed
abstractly by idealism – which, of course, does not know real,
sensuous activity as such. 

~Karl Marx, Theses on Feuerbach, 1845.

PART 1

1. To say is to do.

2. The Trotskyists say a great many things, and they confuse
   people. They are most likely the most impenetrable of the
   socialists in terms of their creed and tradition.
   
3. Here I talk not about orthodox Trotskyists, which are quite
   transparent to approach and comprehend when they speak.
   
4. Here I talk about the unorthodox Trotskyists, those that formed the
   former ISO, what in Australia is known as Socialist Alternative,
   and what in Britain was known as the Socialist Worker's Party.
   

5. The Trotskyists believe everyone had failed, but they have failed
   the best. They believe they are holding a candle in a storm,
   carrying a strict and Catholic tradition of what they, ironically,
   call orthodox Marxism, as opposed to classical, or analytic, or
   structuralist, or Luxemburgist, or 'dogmatic', or
   Marxism-Leninism.*
   
6. The Trotskyists believe we are all operating in the dead of night
   of the revolution. That, like the apostles of Jesus, they have
   received the tongues of fire of the holy spirit, but cannot leave
   their cloister, because the storm they are weathering will not
   lift.
   
7. For them, it is not yet the day time. They must preserve their
   tradition with great rigor, and construct endless propadeutics for
   their members. Of all the traditions I have passed through, and,
   this one for me was quite long, but not the longest, it is the most
   theory-laden, and places probably as its single highest task the
   endless activity of reading and comprehending theoretical
   constructions.
   
*An interesting new invention is Wittgensteinian Leninism. Potentially
a close cousin of Gramscian Marxism.

PART 2

8. I see things a little differently. Today, it is the day time.

9. I am not shielding a candle in torrential rain, I am basking in the
   sun, openly.
   

10. Nothing has yet failed. There is some historical maturity to
    communism, but we are now leaving its adolescence, as far as I am
    concerned, and are entering early adulthood.
	
11. Do not concern yourself with protecting anything. Especially
    beliefs. Especially communism as a science. Communism will always
    be. It will never be replaced by anything else. These are the
    anxieties of the Trotskyists. They say to themselves -- how must
    we be relevant? 
	
12. Such anxieties are fed and fed, and grow and grow inside the
    mentalities and bodily affordances of the Trotskyists to nature,
    life, and the universe.
	
13. Such is the great ... 'squashing' power of the Trotskyists; how
    they are able to coopt and destroy movements. Their anxieties are
    psychotic, they create fictions of personal demons in their
    interpersonal relationships, and consider all creativity and free
    association to be 'prefigurative' politics.
	
14. What have the Trotskyists created lately? The Trotskyists care not
    for creating. They are for preserving. They are holding on to
    their happiness so tightly they have smothered it and killed it.
	
15. I prefer my way. My way is to assert that the experience of the
    world, phenomenologically, is involuntary. Happiness arrives, and
    if it is to persist, it cannot be controlled or confected.
	
16. Perhaps this is a clumsy image of demonstrating my proof, and the
    only way to adduce a proof is to demonstrate it; but, be like the
    living olive tree, always producing fruit. Do not be like the
    Trotskyists who produced the jar of preserved fruit of their tree,
    and are under the illusion that all there is left is their jar of
    olives.
	
17. The olive tree is basking in the open sunlight of communism. It
    is, in a way, perpetually reproducing the garden of Eden for us,
    and for itself. It will never exhaust its bounty. It will erode
    any concrete. It is looked upon by all with favour. 
	
18. It competes with nothing, it senses no obstacles. It has no inside
    or outside, it is flourishing endlessly and eternally.
	
19. Dare to struggle, dare to win. If you do not fight, you lose.
