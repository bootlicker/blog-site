<blockquote>A man will be imprisoned in a room with a door that's unlocked and opens inwards; as long as it does not occur to him to pull rather than push.</blockquote><br/>.<br/>I used to look at this and believe that it meant all my problems were almost imaginary, a matter of my state of mind. I think its closer to the truth to say that <em>a man will be imprisoned in a room because he doesn't understand his surroundings.</em><br/>.<br/>I wouldn't presuppose that it is possible for someone to come out of the state of mind. Or you could take a page out of my mother's book, one should <em>choose to be happy.</em><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-767064903626797533?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
