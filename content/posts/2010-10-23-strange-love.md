<p>I'm forever changed from having watched <em>Doctor Strangelove</em>. I've actually seen it now. It really has everything, it almost sums up who we are without leaving three locations. I think Aristotle was right when he said dramas should have a unity of setting - or something along those lines.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Strangelove</em>Â tells me you can't have your cake and eat it too - and that it's incredible what people can do when the circumstances are dire.</p>&#13;
<p>I'd say imagine you're on the phone to the president with a nuclear strike's termination code whenever you make a decision, however big or small. Imagining you've got the whole world on your shoulders as often as possible should surely help you make the right decisions.</p>&#13;
<p>Me, you; surely we've all got to jump.</p>
