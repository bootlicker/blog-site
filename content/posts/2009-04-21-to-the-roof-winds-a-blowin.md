Very very soon, theamazingfruitsalad.wordpress.com will become totheroof.com!<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Not only will this be an easier URL to remember, but this shiny new website will be about 10 times more awesome, and have about three thousand times less teen angst!<br/><br/>totheroof.com will feature stories and movies and music and pictures, it will be managed by a high-powere-indie-content-management-system just for your alternative needs, and I will be handing out personal accounts for blogging and posting shizz. And games. There'll be pointless web games.<br/><br/>Comments, comments, I want to know what people want!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-969662482890457580?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
