[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-571" alt="glover6" src="http://jumpnshoot9000.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/glover6-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" />][1]This is a 3D platforming game from the late-nineties about an anthropomorphic glove, and its ball. They don&#8217;t get any more abstract than this. Considering, though, that two of the best and most popular 3D platforming main characters were a plumber with various magical caps, and a bear with a red bird in its backpack, the outlandishness of _Glover_&#8216;s protagonist is, strangely, neither here nor there.

_Glover_ is such a different game from your standard late-nineties 3D platformer because its fundamental game-play concept revolves around coordinating yourself with, and balancing yourself against your only tool&#8211;a ball&#8211;which is both indispensably useful for your cause, but incredibly dangerous. The player, as Glover, must bounce, throw, and roll this ball in order to manipulate the game environment and solve puzzles. What makes performing these actions so innovative is that the physics of this undertaking in _Glover_ is so realistic. When the player stands on top of the ball, the controls become inverted. When Glover&#8217;s ball is thrown or bounced against a surface, it bounces away from it along a realistic trajectory. At the touch of a button, you&#8217;re able to transform the quality of your sphere, which can make it lighter or heavier, more or less elastic and so on. After coming to master these basic ideas around which _Glover_ was based, the player should start to feel like they&#8217;re not so much struggling to master and dominate an inanimate object, but beginning to enter into a _partnership_ with a silent and uncommunicative, but nonetheless willingly cooperative second _character_.

The player is sure to have never seriously thought about just how complex it really is to transport themselves up some stairs, or about coordinating themselves up and around a series of simple slopes. The added difficulty is definitely palpable, but with _Glover_, a large, varied, and endlessly useful move-set is at one&#8217;s disposal. Glover&#8217;s ball is a means for such things as reaching distant items and straddling high perches, destroying walls, floating on water, defeating enemies, and providing a speedy escape to tight situations. The incredible number of things that _Glover_&#8216;s developer has managed to enable the player to do with this ball is pretty damn clever.

Getting coordinated with _Glover_&#8216;s ball-based mechanics can at first be difficult, but mastering it will lead to very satisfying game-play.

Game-play aside, the game&#8217;s visuals are colourful and appealing, and it seldom suffers from any frame-rate slowdown or texture clipping. The game&#8217;s textures themselves are simple, but they work together harmoniously to show off a well-constructed atmosphere. _Glover_&#8216;s worlds are incredibly abstract, but satisfyingly coherent, and never shallow. Levels are frequently large, and the N64&#8217;s draw-distance (Z-buffer) limitations are &#8216;concealed&#8217; with copious amounts of fog. This is a bit disappointing because you might find yourself wanting to look beyond the immediate puzzle at hand and give yourself some bearing&#8211;and being unable to do so. Other than that, _Glover_ manages to exploit the features of the N64 reasonably well.

If you have, and think _Glover_&#8216;s not really worth anyone&#8217;s time, then you haven&#8217;t really been responding to what it&#8217;s asking you to do. In many places it will be challenging your hard-wired platforming sensibilities very aggressively.

With so much to offer at dirt cheap prices on eBay, you don&#8217;t have anything to lose&#8211;and so much to gain!&#8211;by picking up a copy of _Glover_.
