> First Day:

people walking around with airpods

are they talking on the phone, or to their friends?

> Second Day

More people wearing air pods walking and running around talking to themselves. 
Who thought they were a good idea?? The dude in the lift in my apartment block 
apologised to me after loudly and animatedly talking and me just... standing 
there. It's pretty crazy. No-one is there! But you're talking really intensely! 
Reminds me of curb your enthusiasm. If I was just ranting in the lift to myself 
while not on the phone, and then loudly declared: " BEEP! Oh! Sorry, I was 
talking interplanet", it would be no less weird!!
