This is a really interesting project! Find some links here for three different attempts at making a point-and-shoot camera using a Raspberry Pi, and the Raspberry Pi camera!

[The Holga 120N Project](http://notes.pitfall.org/raspberry-pi-holga-digital-camera.html)

[Another 120N Project](http://kimondo.co.uk/raspberry-pi-camera-case-from-a-holga/)

Each of the different projects have custom features, and they are all different! Some allow different filters, some have built in web-servers for previewing images, and others huge very large external batteries!
