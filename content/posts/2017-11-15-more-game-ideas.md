  1. Laika Spreads Communism 
      1. The first animal in space flies around the galaxy establishing contact with alien planets and teaches them about the wonderful ways of socialism.
  2. The Long March 
      1. A silly tankie tried to re stage Mao&#8217;s long march. The game begins with poorly compressed wavetable at thesis.
      2. I imagine it will be a cross between a platformer and a walking simulator.
      3. When you get to the end, Mao tells you to go back the other way, the way you came.
