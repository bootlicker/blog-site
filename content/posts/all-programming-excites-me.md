I am keen to work on projects, but here I am having to write C for my uni 
labs... Well, I suppose I can at least have an /understanding/ and maybe even 
/appreciation/ of C, I guess.

I think I might be able to work on a LISP project for my keystone unit in my 
last semester. I think that at least might be possible.

I am sort of excited to be able to have a unit where I formally program, though. 
I have waited my whole life to actually be able to get a computer science 
qualification and actually work and get paid to be a programmer.

That much at least is what excites me about writing C. I know I complain a lot 
about imperative languages, but all programming excites me.
