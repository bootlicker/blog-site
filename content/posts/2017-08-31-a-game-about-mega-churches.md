This will be a game about reversing the indoctrination of people as they exit mega churches to vote NO in the marriage equality survey.

  1. People will spew out of a moving mega church in a circular motion in 8 directions.
  2. You must use a Cultural Marxism Ray to change the colour of the &#8220;pellet-people&#8221;.
  3. When the pellet-people reach the edge of the border, a good colour will increase the player&#8217;s score, a bad colour increase the NO-vote score.
  4. There will be Catholic Archbishops moving around the screen laying Incense Mines to slow down the player.
