Here's to you, Mister Shaw. You taught me Advanced Maths and GT, you're a big reason I've ever done anything in maths. Although I was a great big disappointment in all of your classes, I'd just like you to know - where-ever you are now - you're one of my heroes.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-3918039692923977053?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
