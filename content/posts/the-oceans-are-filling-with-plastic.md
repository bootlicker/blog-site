A poem by _Tim Gallagher_

(the oceans are filling with plastic)

monstrous administration!
suicidal teeth!
cantankerous correllas
hurricane past my window
spider mincing along the roof
screaming about rain and violins
immortalise my spinach with
burnt willow charcoal
gosh this wine is appalling
belt loops full of blasphemy
frantic licking knickers
morse code mammories
I love you
the figs are dyeing in kings square!
the figs are dyeing in kings square!
penguins eating fairy floss
cunt-stible care run over by the whippy van
fat cat is a horse faced predator
hopscotch court hospitals
i think we should elope
hoodinni stomache ache
ballerina burleske
polyamorous pooh-sticks
gonzo town planning
water saving windscreen wipers
rampage flirting
the closet is more full of people than the room!
the closet is more full of people than the room!
deserts of lettice
shoelace pirates
lunatics with landlines
auto erotic population inflation
negligent fruitcake
harmonica thermometers
turpentine swimming pools
star spangled star fuckers
the oceans are filling with plastic
the oceans are filling with plastic
here comes the drum solo
yurt gherkins
Persian rug munchers`
I think you've made me pregnant
pedestrian with a dancey walk
social media mummification
upperclass anorexia
botanical banditry
zoological zionists
dexamphetamine addicted dogs
ghetto grannys
I want to die inside your womb
cigarette smoking snorkelers
vampire tax
yoda loving yuppies
the ozone is going on holiday
the ozone is going on holiday
please don't leave just yet.
