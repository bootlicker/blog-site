A poem by _Tim Gallagher_

(the oceans are filling with plastic)

monstrous administration!<br>
suicidal teeth!<br>
cantankerous correllas <br>
hurricane past my window<br>
spider mincing along the roof<br>
screaming about rain and violins<br>
immortalise my spinach with<br>
burnt willow charcoal<br>
gosh this wine is appalling<br>
belt loops full of blasphemy<br>
frantic licking knickers<br>
morse code mammories<br>
I love you<br>
the figs are dyeing in kings square!<br>
the figs are dyeing in kings square!<br>
penguins eating fairy floss<br>
cunt-stible care run over by the whippy van<br>
fat cat is a horse faced predator<br>
hopscotch court hospitals<br>
i think we should elope<br>
hoodinni stomache ache<br>
ballerina burleske<br>
polyamorous pooh-sticks<br>
gonzo town planning<br>
water saving windscreen wipers<br>
rampage flirting<br>
the closet is more full of people than the room!<br>
the closet is more full of people than the room!<br>
deserts of lettice<br>
shoelace pirates<br>
lunatics with landlines<br>
auto erotic population inflation<br>
negligent fruitcake<br>
harmonica thermometers<br>
turpentine swimming pools<br>
star spangled star fuckers<br>
the oceans are filling with plastic<br>
the oceans are filling with plastic<br>
here comes the drum solo<br>
yurt gherkins<br>
Persian rug munchers`<br>
I think you've made me pregnant<br>
pedestrian with a dancey walk<br>
social media mummification<br>
upperclass anorexia<br>
botanical banditry<br>
zoological zionists<br>
dexamphetamine addicted dogs<br>
ghetto grannys<br>
I want to die inside your womb<br>
cigarette smoking snorkelers<br>
vampire tax<br>
yoda loving yuppies<br>
the ozone is going on holiday<br>
the ozone is going on holiday<br>
please don't leave just yet.<br>
