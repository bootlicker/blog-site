I have completed a stage in development of my Atari 2600 game! Please find attached a ZIP file containing the binary, and the source code. I hope this may help someone learn how to program the Atari 2600 themselves. This kernel draws a main player character who can move up and down the whole length of the screen, and 5 bands of repeated graphics from the second player graphics register. This code therefore turns 2 graphics registers into 6 graphics onscreen!
