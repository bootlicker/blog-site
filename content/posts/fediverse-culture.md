There is a classic post structure emerging online:

IF YOU THINK OR ARE ADJACENT TO X YOU ARE AN ARSEHOLE

There's a saying I learned about recently, from the dawn of email: never put 
anything in an email you wouldn't put on a postcard.

I think the same goes for massively public online spaces like the fediverse. 
Airing your grievances online in a way for everyone to see is the same as 
gossiping in high school.

What kind of culture do we want here on the fedi? I want one of mutual support 
and friendly self reflection. For the most part the fediverse is the best place 
on the internet - we're actually far more open to learning and growing than the 
next massive online platform.

But we do have some weird negative cultural aspects to our online behaviour. 
Like really vague, yet emotionally charged tirades about people having bad 
politics. I am still completely unclear about so much drama because it is all 
centred around cliques and in-crowds.

Generally speaking, I deal with grievances I have with people's racism or 
homophobia or bad politics in a formal and structured way. Remember the famous 
anarchist article 'the tyranny of structurelessness'? That lesson is worth 
revisiting time and time again: gossip and informal communication and 
decision-making is able to be manipulated by people seeking to enforce 
illegitimate authority.

Where am I going with this? I dunno. Oh yeah: if you think you need to go on 
massive rants, have a think about your language. You might be completely 
justified about your need to communicate an issue! But think: do I need to do 
this publicly??
