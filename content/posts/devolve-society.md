I agree with my comrade. One thing we should be pushing for is the devolving of 
civilisation into smaller units. We could have handled this epidemic 
democratically if we lived in small communes. The discussion we had was based on 
the topic of bolo'bolo - which I take to be a really enlightening read.

We could have sealed off our bolos and dealt with the epidemic in a collective 
way, instead of using the security state and it's armed bodies of oppression.

One of the amazing things about this crisis, though, is that I think it has 
single handedly ended neoliberalism. I'm willing to call it- it's over! We're in 
a war economy now, in Australia.
