Check out this presentation on non-binary computing! It&#8217;s for an entry for the <a href="http://hackaday.com/" target="_blank">Hackaday</a> Prize, a competition to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hackaday&#8217;s founding.

The presentation discusses ternary logic, a non-binary number system that uses three logical states instead of two. Ternary was used in the late 1950s as a practical way of constructing computers more efficiently. As the original Hackaday article notes, the 1950s Soviet ternary logic computer, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setun" target="_blank">Setun</a>, was able to compute more data using less vacuum tubes due to the use of ternary logic. It was more efficient.
