This is a tweet i just made: This 1981 
BBC show "The Computer Program" is 
amazing. We have nowhere near the level 
of non-neoliberal computer literacy 
today. The fourth episode explicitly 
predicted the crimes of facebook, google, 
apple and twitter. It actually said the 
words: 

> "We need to make sure we have 
clear rules for who is allowed to access 
and manipulate what computers and 
information. We should be wary of Big 
Brother on computers". 

It also clearly explains how computers work, their 
various components and parts. I received 
absolutely no computer education as a 
child, in the 90s and 00s. I was given no 
reasoning for why computers were useful, 
why they were important at all. I was 
given no education about the significance 
of computers for our society, or for 
capitalism. I was of course not given any 
education about the significance of 
computers for /socialism/. 

I would hack my school's computer systems, and I got 
into trouble, but I was merely yelled 
at and scolded. I was not given any 
reason for my punishment apart from "this 
is not your property"; "intellectual 
property should be respected". No one has 
ever educated me on internet security. 
Neither data security. 

I have seen people line up for hours and spend thousands of 
dollars on iPhones while having no 
knowledge of the crimes of the Apple 
corporation, or the crimes of Microsoft, 
when they now /rent/ their word 
processors. Where are the TV shows on 
mainstream TV telling us about how Intel 
CPU speculative execution has rendered 
almost every desktop and laptop computer 
is now almost impossible NOT to hack. 
Where are the histories of the internet 
before web 2.0? Where are the mainstream 
criticisms of HTTP? Why is everything 
connected to the internet all the time? 
How can we get secure? Everyone is using 
the internet, but where is the education 
for it?

Neoliberalism's pernicious ideology has taken over our understanding of how and why to use computers. We don't have a good social and science of computing anymore. We are not all walking businesses, as if when we open our eyes we are for sale.
