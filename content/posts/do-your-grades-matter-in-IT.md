okay from the feedback i have received, it seems like no-one cares how
well you did at uni in order to get a job being a programmer, and most
of the time what bosses only really care about is if you have a degree
or not.

perhaps that's a bit strong language - it doesn't seem very critical
that you have amazing grades in order to get a job coming out of uni
to be a programmer or software dev etc.

i hope this information i have collected makes it to someone who finds
it useful :-)
