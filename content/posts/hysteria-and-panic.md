fuck. i am so angry at the mainstream TV media.

this reporter on channel 7 is literally yelling at the camera about this
corona virus.

i was thinking today about how these propaganda networks should be
held responsible for whipping up all this hysteria and fear.

people were turning their heads angrily when people were randomly
coughing on the bus today.

i am so, so mad. this free to air TV stuff is so, so toxic.

there is NO reason to be afraid, and there is NO reason to believe
conspiracies about ANY of this.

i am done. if people talk about the corona virus i am gonna excuse
myself from the conversation.

You know, I don't think anyone has had it explained to them what the
corona virus is.

The way it is being spun is as if it is some sort of plague which you
need to avoid like the devil, or else you will die and regret your
life.

I honestly cannot be bothered teaching myself what this 'plague' is,
though.

I cannot express how much I am over this bullshite.
