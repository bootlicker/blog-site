it's a long blue monday
this year
the party ended sometime in
December 2016
.
would you face reality,
this one time, Ellie?
We lost
.
"I'm not stopping.
If I have to go it alone, 
I'll go it alone.
I've done it before"
.
I'll find my inspiration somewhere
I'll reach out of this funk,
or be lifted out.
