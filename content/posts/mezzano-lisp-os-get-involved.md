I think I'd really like to contribute to the Mezzano LISP operating system 
project. It's very poorly documented, though. Perhaps that's where I could 
start, but I need some sort of understanding about how the code works first.

My first attempt at working out how the Mastodon code worked was to read the 
earliest committed code. I think I will do the same with Mezzano.

It's a bit rich to sit down and email froggey and ask them to explain what is 
going on. I will investigate further and report back.
