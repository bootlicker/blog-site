i am right there with you if you're:

- in precarious employment
- in precarious or unstable living arrangements
- being bullied in your workplace
- skipping meals
- are absolutely exhausted, even after sleeping
- have poor mental health exacerbated by stress and poverty
- have literally no-one who will listen or give a shit
- feel fucking forgotten and just pushing and pushing to keep your head above water

you can do it.
