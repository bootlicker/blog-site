For a good discussion on how using CD-Rs with your _Dreamcast_ might affect its operation, see [this thread][2] on the Racketboy forums from 2010.

&#8212;

Aside: Looking through the _Dreamcast_&#8216;s library of games, I recently come across Ikaruga ([Wikipedia][3], [Hardcoregaming101][4], [Videogamecritic][5]), a pretty damn exceptional _Dreamcast _shoot&#8217;em up made by none other than [Treasure][6]. This in turn lead me to their direct sequel of the_ _[Starwing][7]-rivalling Mega-CD title Silpheed ([Wiki][8], [HKG101][9], [VGC][10]), Silpheed: The Lost Planet ([Wiki][11], [HKG101][12], [VGC][13]). Lost Planet is an unexceptional game, unlike its Mega-CD ancestor, but it is faithful to the Silpheed &#8216;formula&#8217;: enormous detailed backgrounds. In true Treasure form, also, Lost Planet features frequent boss and mini-boss battles, which is fairly uncommon in the shoot&#8217;em up genre.

The reason why I make this digression is because it is one of those rare instances where big features of video game history coincide: Dreamcast&#8211;Treasure&#8211;Mega-CD. It&#8217;s also a [reasonably cheap][14] way of getting access to some Mega-CD-like gameplay for which you would otherwise have to shell out lots of money. See below for some YouTube video footage of Silpheed: Lost Planet.
