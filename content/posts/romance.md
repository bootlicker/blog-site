i think i am going to have to be single, whether i like it or not

it is not possible for me to be in a relationship right now, and that makes me 
very sad

i just don't know anyone IRL who i am interested in who is also interested in me

it sucks but that's the way it is

i suppose this is a part of getting older, you just... end up being single, 
whether you like it or not

it's quite a painful feeling, knowing or seemingly predicting that i will not 
have a love for a long time

i don't think i know anyone online who is also interested in me either

i am very rarely ever sad or negative, i suppose my thoughts just turned to this 
right now for some reason haha

i really feel happy for all the people i know online who are in relationships, 
whether they be IRL or online. you all fill me with so much joy. i wish i could 
have what you have :-)
