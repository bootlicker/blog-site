Hello I am the cyber druid of the temperate climate region of the western coast 
of this continent

I am not sure what the wadjuk people of the nyoongar nation, the people who own 
this land think of this, but...

I can call upon my robot and cybernetic friends of the hills and the Beeliar 
region in times of need

They will come trundling and beeping sure enough if I summon them
