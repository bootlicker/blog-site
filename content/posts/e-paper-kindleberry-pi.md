I have been putting some effort into 
developing a portable device that I can 
use to replace my phone. My smart phone 
has many poor features:

1. Poor battery life.
2. Awful touch screen 'soft' keyboard
3. Full of 'Google Services' CPU 
processes that require the operating 
system to function.
4. Poor cell data reception.
5. Weak construction that is difficult to 
repair: I dropped it, and the glass 
screen smashed. The audio jack has also 
now failed, making it useless for 
listening to music.
6. Illogical file system structure.

The phone does have some benefits - 

1. Its ability to act as a USB gateway 
makes it useful for internet in remote locations.
2. It does possess a terminal emulator, 
making it great for interfacing with my 
VPS.
3. The GPS module is very convenient for 
getting around new places.
4. The front-facing camera is great for 
making vlogs because you get a live 
preview of the footage being filmed.

Overall, the issues of poor text input 
and lack of ability to hack the device 
push me towards finding a solution for 
portable computing. I also want to 
start using less HTTP and more of other 
protocols for my communication.

I believe there is a command line 
mastodon client, NNTP is a convenient 
text based communication protocol, and 
email has long used the command line.
