My second project for the other part of the sum of cash I have will be a Single Board Computer &#8211; based on a Motorola 68k-family CPU. Here is a collection of processors which may be interesting to use:

**MC68882** &#8211; Floating Point Operations Unit ([Link][1])

**MC68030FE25C** &#8211; Quad Flat Package of the 68030, 25 MHz ([Link][2])
