  This is a game about a couple of aliens who are trying to reassemble their spaceship so that they can return to their home planet, Funkotron. As you&#8217;re likely to read elsewhere, the game mechanics owe a large part of their heritage to <em>Rogue</em>, a game for the personal computer from 1980, but, for important reasons, TJ&E escaped following those those roots too closely, and did not become anything like <em>Diablo</em>, or&#8211;and this might be stretching the limits of the dungeon-crawling genre&#8211;<em>Baldur&#8217;s Gate</em>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  It has been complained that TJ&E is &#8216;just a game about walking around&#8217;; this is supremely ignorant. The player, whether playing with another (as &#8216;intended&#8217;) or by themselves, <em>will</em> do a lot of walking around, but this does not limit the game. What drives TJ&E  is the idea that you&#8217;re exploring something, getting deeper and deeper into the world with which you&#8217;re interacting &c. <em>This</em> is what makes this a really, really good game.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  All the levels you play through are randomly generated, and all of the items littered throughout the game have to be <em>used</em> in order to function discovered: everything gets rotated, mixed around, when you start again. The items themselves are genuinely helpful to game-play, and are authentically imaginative. In fact the very freedom the player has to roam around and explore the level, checking the map, figuring things out, is what <em>makes</em> this game. Most commentary on TJ&E reserves all the praise for its music&#8211;and the music is brilliant, Herbie Hancock-esque funk that loops perfectly&#8211;but the sandbox dimension to the game is what keeps me coming back.

<p style="text-align:left;">
  I can go on about the levels&#8217; terrain, the various enemies, the game&#8217;s difficulty curve, but you need to go and play this game.

<p style="text-align:left;">
  ToeJam & Earl is available on the Sega Mega Drive (both the console and cartridge can be bought fairly cheaply online), and the Wii Virtual Console, for 800 Wii Points.
