What I learned in my political science masters is that most of the
time, institutional and state prosecuted violence between states is
usually a result of either:

A. Miscommunication
B. Incorrect interpretation of information
C. Incomplete information
D. Information which arrives out of order to arrives too late

In other words, massive organised warfare and violence is a result of
irrationality. State armed forces are bureaucracies. States do not,
most of the time, understand the motivations or self understanding of
the cultures they destroy and corrupt.

For this reason we can conclude that the military is irrational and
against the flourishing of human nature.
