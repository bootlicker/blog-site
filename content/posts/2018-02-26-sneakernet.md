So it turns out our ADSL in this house is so bad we get logged out of our Xbox Live account. This prevents us from being able to use VLC, to watch MKV files &#8211; which many dramas are encoded in.

It makes me think &#8211; what if we set up a sneakernet? A sneakernet is a physical delivery of digital data. You might walk a USB stick to your friend&#8217;s house. You might download a library of movies from your friend onto a hard drive and drive it home.

It has been proven that carrier pigeons are faster than ADSL internet. I bet they&#8217;re faster in terms of bandwidth than the Australian NBN. The internet in Australia is so bad, I think we may have to resort to a sneakernet in order to keep information flowing.

What do you think?
