carl sagan says 
the exploration of the cosmos 
is a voyage 
of self-discovery
.
the navigation of my
emotional cosmos,
my voyage of self-discovery,
i thought,
was taking one path
and not another
.
in much the same way
that learning about stars
makes the universe
"much grander than [one]
had ever guessed",
becoming an adult seems
like the most difficult thing
one can ever do.
