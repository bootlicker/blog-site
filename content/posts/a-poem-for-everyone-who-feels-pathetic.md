``
carl sagan says <br>
the exploration of the cosmos <br>
is a voyage <br>
of self-discovery <br>
. <br>
the navigation of my <br>
emotional cosmos, <br>
my voyage of self-discovery, <br>
i thought, <br>
was taking one path <br>
and not another <br>
. <br>
in much the same way <br>
that learning about stars <br>
makes the universe <br>
"much grander than [one] <br>
had ever guessed", <br>
becoming an adult seems <br>
like the most difficult thing <br>
one can ever do. <br>
