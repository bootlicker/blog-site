Was planning to jump my own VDSL connection in my apartment block's main 
distribution frame today, with a suggestion from my comrade ... Until I 
chickened out. If the technician supposedly coming on Friday doesn't solve the 
problem, I will engage in illegalist activities in order to self connect my own 
internet.

I'm more than happy to declare this to the open internet

Because it will prove a point: the only way to connect the internet 2 suburbs 
out of the centre of Perth City is to literally do it yourself.

Internet companies and the Australian capitalist state are crooks
