<p>I will be using the Free Software program <em>Qucs</em> to plan out the electronics of the RAVEN.</p>

<p>The digital electronics of this computer will be based on the R-Series logic of the DEC PDP-8/S.</p>

<p>I started planning out the registers of the RAVEN, following this 'cookbook' suggestion inside the 1967 DEC <em>Logic Handbook</em>:</p>

<p>The DIRECT SET lines will not be tied together, and they will not be unbuffered. The DIRECT SET lines will have a three state input implemented with an extra R-Series Diode-Capacitor-Diode Gate attached to each <em>separated</em> DIRECT SET line:</p>

<p>So the extra 'CLEAR MDR' control signal will be implemented by attaching all DIRECT CLEAR lines together. This will be useful for the CLEAR STACK CELL control signal/sequence.</p>

<h1>Flip-Flops Required for Registers</h1>

<p>This is a 5-input single Flip-Flop as specified by DEC Flip-Chip code R201:</p>

<p>And this is the corresponding circuit schematic in <em>Qucs</em>:</p>

<p>And this is the sub-circuit schematic that is generated by attaching ports to the appropriate inputs and outputs:</p>

<p>Now the registers can be designed (and hopefully simulated) in Qucs and an accurate Bill of Materials can be generated.</p>
