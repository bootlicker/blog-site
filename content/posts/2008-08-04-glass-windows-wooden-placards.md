How colourful was the music and drama centre today? I was standing outside the auditorium and I just couldn't help feeling like I was in a time machine, like I was back in year eight.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>I felt like I was surrounded by all the names in gold letters and the cold blue sky was raining this wonderful yellow-grey light onto me. It was almost perfect, I just don't understand the feeling of complete happiness I felt at that very moment.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>It was only yesterday that I was in the very same place, feeling so alien and despondent with those surroundings. What a couple of days, huh?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5693059957647979680-6190957421855401192?l=cosmiccowbell.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
