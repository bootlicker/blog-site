Well, Jon Blow&#8217;s _The Witness_ is going to be released [exclusively on the PS4][1]. That is in terms of its availability in the guise of a console game, however. Those seeking the game on the PC or through an iOS device won&#8217;t be presented with a sweaty dilemma.

[<img class="alignright  wp-image-564" alt="the witness undertree" src="http://jumpnshoot9000.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/the-witness-undertree.jpg" width="372" height="199" />][2]I&#8217;ve always been magpie-like in my choice of console, and have usually arrived at the conclusion after some time that my original choice was pretty much outright wrong. This bit of experience, combined with the fact that my respect for Blow and his [ethics][3], as well as his [design philosophy][4], makes me want to pick up _The Witness_ as early as I can, makes me question my initial disappointment that Blow didn&#8217;t choose to make a Wii U release a priority.

Well, never mind that for now. Blow featured _Antichamber_ on _The Witness_&#8216;s blog, a very different kind of first-person puzzle game. Take a look at its teaser trailer:

After watching part of this [walkthrough/let&#8217;s play][5], it becomes obvious that the fundamental concept that drives this game has borrowed from quantum physics&#8211;the [observer effect][6]. It&#8217;s fantastic![

The reader can find its Steam page [here][8] (digital copies for $20, not unreasonable for an independently developed game), and its website [here][9].
