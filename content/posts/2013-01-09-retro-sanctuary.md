&#8216;Top game&#8217; lists (&#8216;Top 100 Sega games&#8217; &c) are bad, and people should stop making and reading them, but despite that, the people over at _[Retro-Sanctuary][1]_ do a brilliant job of them. Despite the conceptual incoherence of ranking games, the lists that _RS _compiles do a good job of helping one gain an understanding of how the libraries of third, fourth and fifth generation platforms are related to amongst themselves._

The [ported-games comparisons][2] section that the website has developed features a really good run-down of the differences between the [Earthworm Jim ports][3] of the early 90s. What is particularly interesting about the article on EWJ is its discussion of the different graphics capabilities of the SNES and the Mega Drive&#8211;specifically, the Mega Drive&#8217;s use of [dithering][4] as a remedy for its limited on-screen colour palette.
