i play a lot of weird association games in my head:

- saying "KRAFF!" instead of 'crab'
- the movie hudson hawk
- the movie 'the craft'

so, i resolve to:

> make a game about a crab cat burglar who sings songs while stealing. you steal 
repeatedly from richard dawkins, and your sidekick is a teenage witch

> the game will be called THE KRAFF

(i am still making the Oats for Goats game, i am making it for the April LISP 
game jam C:)
