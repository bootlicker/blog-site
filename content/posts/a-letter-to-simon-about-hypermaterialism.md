 HEY

So the basis of my theory of 'hypermaterialism' is this book called /The
Dominant Ideology Thesis/ from say '80 or '81. It's definitely an analytic
book, but I think it is worthwhile. My whole strategy is to 'bend the
stick' hard towards economism, but then tack hard towards voluntarism, in a way
that gels with my ontology of 'proletarian morality'. This philosophy is
supposed to be suited for literally /right now/, while things are still
kicking off and we don't need to worry too much about organisational forms.
Literally any kind of activity and activism is acceptable right now --
within /some/ limits of course, but ultra-left stuff like banner drops
outside of prisons, or just doing small scale demoes out the front of restaurants
that underpay their workers is all awesome and should be encouraged.

I also mean to make a bit of an intervention into Australian politics. I
am a little persuaded by the ideas of red unionism, and I think competitive
unionism like the RAFFWU, and advocating for the disaffiliation of unions
from the ALP is a good thing. Perhaps even having unions work outside the scope
of the ACTU is acceptable. All this fits into my... 'let a thousand flowers
bloom' approach to right now.

I could even get a bit cheeky and say I mean to take a leaf out of the
book of Buddhism, and say my philosophy of hypermaterialism is meant to be
a 'hyperpassive' system -- which permits voluntarism and the flowering of
lots of new forms of organisation. So my kind of voluntarism could be a kind of
'interpassive' activity -- in the same way that female Bangladeshi textile
workers engage in comradeship by being ironic about their own suicide.

This is me completely spitballing, because I really do believe in the
spontaneity of the human spirit, but I think the way to take on capitalism
is to take its ideological force of interpassivity seriously, and
short-circuit it.

For instance, my ontology about proletarian morality is completely passive
-- you just need to detect the right virtues, and follow them in order to
have the correct will in accordance with the environment. So in this way
the slogans of my ontology and political philosophy are:

- There is a correct and virtuous way to act
- But anything is possible, and whatever seems like a plurality of ways of
acting is usually always one way
- Because anything is possible, be open to anything
- Because anything is possible, it is usually okay to do anything
- Anything is usually the only one way to do achieve socialism

—> I haven’t read this, but it’s by an up and coming french philosopher and
the name sounded familiar!

— In any case, I like zizek’s answer to the whole issue of there being no
dominant ideology (unifying hegemonic worldview) today —> that it does
still exist, but mainly on the level of enjoyment & desire (ie. casual
resentment towards every group getting an ‘unfair advantage’, suspicion of
the other who enjoys (migrants, the unemployed), disillusionment with all
metanarrative (which as Jameson argues, is itself a meta-narrative where
there can be no utopian ideal beyond capitalism).

This isn’t necessarily against what you argue later — I think it’s the
ideological terrain of ‘interpassivity’ that we have to go *with* rather
than *against* — kinda like ‘antipolitics’ for Tietze & Humphries, whereas
modern cynicism towards politics can be both the grounds for right wing
populism but also left wing populism (maybe populism isn’t the right word
though).

>My whole strategy is to 'bend the stick' hard towards economism, but then

I like this idea! except perhaps you could push it further, and break any kind of dialectical or reciprocal relation between economism and
voluntarism (where the bending the stick metaphor would apply), and instead
posit a completely different relation between the two spheres (that of
human need of desire - the economy - and the realm of human will and
collective decision-making - politics. I like zizek’s idea here again, of
the economy being the ‘real’ to the political symbolic (and i guess
ideology is the imaginary here) —> the economy, or more accurately the
organisation of labour (activity, desire, consumption..) is the absolute
basis for politics, but can only be spoken of within the discourse of
politics (given desire or ‘interests’ are never transparently given within
the realm of language / representation).

The only criticism I have is of a ‘proletarian morality’! I don’t think you
can attach moral Truth to any particular section of society, even though
particular sections may be better at ‘bearing’ it (so it’s not a subject /
object relationship, where the subject has ‘their’ morality corresponding
to their economic position —> morality in terms of communism, which posits
complete generic equality of all humans (speaking animals), is something
that arises immanently within struggle against the dominant order,
regardless of who is struggling (I take this from Badiou, who develops it
from Sartre and his attempts to theorise the fusion-group in struggle)). In
other words morality is drawn from opposition to capitalism, and not any
positive element within it.

I agree! I reckon the attitude towards unions (reform vs separate) should
be purely strategic, after all we’re not dealing with the mighty
organisations of the workers movement but the husks of its severe defeat.
I’m impressed by the approach of the DSA, who give their branches a large
amount of autonomy to participate in whatever local struggles they see fit
(fight for 15, black lives matter, anti-gentrification, etc.). We’re
definitely in the slowly-rebuilding phase of a new workers movement, and it
would never work if this was limited to workers of singular workplaces
rather than the variety of different issues that are politicising
communities and allow collective organising. That said, our philosophy does
have to take into account organisation insofar as they must be able to
respond to ‘Events’ - upsurges of struggle that by coming into conflict
with the State set off a battle of strategy, which involves organisations
and their capacity to subordinate themselves and respond to events (ie.
mass democracy beyond the organised sections).

>I could even get a bit cheeky and say I mean to take a leaf out of the book

'interpassive' activity -- in the same way that female Bangladeshi textile
workers engage in comradeship by being ironic about their own suicide.

Again, I think I agree with what you’re saying! I especially believe that
the highly fragmented and differentiated nature of the working class
today *necessitates* a variety of forms of organisation, covering different forms of
territories, workplaces, industries, oppressions, or even different
relations to the state (say parliamentary, local council, etc —> after all,
we’re always within the state somewhere, incorporated within its
strategies, so the questions is how to establish a relation among a
plurality of different organisations, necessary to represent the
multiplicity of desires that always exceed the State or some attempt to ‘mirror’ the state (like the old Labour / Communist parties, where
political bodies must move in one single disciplined motion in order to
counter the power of the State)). The only thing is, again, you have to
differentiate between ‘normal’ political times — where desires and
self-organisation can exceed the grasp of the State, but clearly not throw
it into crisis — and ‘evental’ times, whereby a mass-assembly of people
posit a new form of generic equality against the State and open up a new
strategic terrain where it is possibly to overthrow the existing hegemony
from the viewpoint of this new political Subject. After all, if things are
left at the level of everyday voluntarism (which is everyday desire and the
way our desires and encounters with one another always tend towards
exceeding the State’s grasp / categorisations), you’re basically left at
the level of Deleuzian immanence & Autonomist organisation (which isn’t a
bad thing in-itself, just incomplete!).

>This is me completely spitballing, because I really do believe in the
spontaneity of the human spirit, but I think the way to take on capitalism
is to take its ideological force of interpassivity seriously, and
short-circuit it.

Like I said before, I like this idea a lot but reckon the terminology
should shift! Insofar as organisation should prioritise *desire* (which is
spontaneity in your terminology - but I reckon desire is more accurate
because it exists prior to its elaboration into our ‘will’, which always
occurs through language / ideology. Think of it as the Lacanian ‘real’ —
lack, the void of subjectivity, immanent to the world — vs. the idea of
spontaneous human spirit having any positive content prior to
language/ideology, which is implicit within Deleuzo-vitalism, where the
‘virtual’ pre-exists its actualisation (a dualism that betrays immanence).

But anyway, I like the idea of short-circuiting neoliberal ideology itself!
Especially as neoliberal ideology is aimed at organising desire / enjoyment
as more ‘real’ or valid than any kind of political metanarrative (which is
seen as naive, utopian — think of South Park’s libertarianism) — for
example the neoliberal restructuring of the state no longer believes in the
benevolence of state bureaucrats (representing ‘reason’), and so puts in
place a whole system of incentives and punishments meant to hold the public sector ‘accountable’ (hence the market is associated with being realistic
that people are desiring animals - selfish, greedy, incapable of commitment
to a higher moral cause). The corresponding ideology - the public sector is
bloated, greedy, etc. is clearly the source of a lot of anti-political
sentiment today. But like you said, and similar to Tietze & Humphries, this
ideology shouldn’t be challenged from the perspective of re-invigorating
the political (social democracy), but using the very cynicism and passivity
of neoliberal ideology against itself, but posing a critique of the state
altogether. I think that’s what you mean by interpassivity anway!


>For instance, my ontology about proletarian morality is completely passive
-- you just need to detect the right virtues, and follow them in order to

acting is usually always one way
- Because anything is possible, be open to anything
- Because anything is possible, it is usually okay to do anything
- Anything is usually the only one way to do achieve socialism

Again, I really like this but I reckon you need the perspective of radical
breaks (events) as well, and a theorisation of subjectivity as the void
within social substance! Other your philosophy ends up being highly similar
to Deleuzian immanence ahaha, but I reckon the key point is correct: there
is always a multiplicity that exceeds the State, and therefore a plurality
of ways of organising (forming ‘positive encounters’ with others,
encounters which strengthen our collective capacity to act (which is the
direct counterpart of the effects depression has upon our bodies, diminishing our capacity to act in the world)). Having said that, the
Badiouian rejoinder would be that this is all well and good, but it is no
grounds for *morality* itself, understood as Truth. Truth, if you want to
stick to immanence, can only be formed our of the limit of the existing
situation itself, the void that is the inherent multiplicity that always
exceeds representation. In struggle, we pose this void directly —> and thus
posit the generic equality of all people involved whose very identities are
subtracted (bracketed away) in the moment of opposition to the State. I
haven’t made this argument very well, but you get the point — the issue is
from what epistemological standpoint we can judge which practice is the
‘virtuous’ one, something that to me can only be decided upon in relation
to an event, a radical break in existing Hegemony and the active assembly
of people (ie. soviets). I’ll try to elaborate on this later on!
