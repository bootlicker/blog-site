<p>i suspect you had the time,</p>
<p>but were weak-willed.</p>
<p>yes, you were so inclined,</p>
<p>yet could not go in for the kill.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>i understand, and</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>i admit my perception may be wrong</p>
<p>in which case i have a defence:</p>
<p>it really was the end; our swansong</p>
<p>to stay longer would not have made much sense.</p>
