If it's one thing I've learned, no one single label or creed of Anarchist or 
Communist applies to me. If the radicals online are anything to go by, I am not 
like them. My kind of libertarian communism is my own, and when I describe 
myself as an anarchist and communist, I usually do so to give a mere impression 
or foothold and a general guide to my audience about what kind of person I am 
politically.

Roughly speaking, yes, I am an anarchist, and yes, I am a communist. But I am 
not a stereotypical one, or one that follows any tradition or thinker completely 
in any form.

I think this goes for many others too.
