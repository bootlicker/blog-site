These are the best games I have ever played. I only included games which I have actually played!

  * Yar&#8217;s Revenge (2600)
  * Berzerk (2600)
  * Commando (2600)
  * River Raid (2600)
  * Dark Chambers (2600)
  * ADOM (PC)
  * Crash Bandicoot Series (PlayStation 1) (Although I hated the games as a child because they were far too difficult. It took me half a decade to complete the game. I thought that there was something wrong with me for not being able to master the game. It took until my cousins from overseas came for me to progress to the next world of Crash 2. I couldn&#8217;t believe my luck when they completed the first world for me.)

  * Yoshi&#8217;s Island (SNES) (Was way better than Super Mario World)
  * Red Faction: Guerilla (PS3) (Possibly my favourite game)
  * Banjo Kazooie (N64)
  * Banjo Tooie (N64)
  * Yooka Laylee (XBONE)
  * Digimon: Rumble Arena (PS1) (Not actually a good game, but I still had loads of fun with it)
  * Zelda: Ocarina of Time (N64) (I loved the open world feeling to this game. I spent so much time in this game doing nothing of consequence. For most of my childhood I never got past the first three dungeons. My brother completed the game several times, however. The artistic direction in this game is simply amazing.)
  * Exhumed/Powerslave (Saturn) (An amazing Doom clone)
  * Mischief Makers (N64)
  * Zelda: Link&#8217;s Awakening DX (GBC)
  * Double Dragon 2 (NES)
  * Mega Man 2 (NES)
  * Shenmue (DC)
  * Day of Defeat 1.6 (PC)
  * Day of Defeat Source (PC)
  * Adventure (2600)
  * Mario Kart (N64)
  * Super Mario 64 (N64)
  * Ikari Warriors (NES)
  * Earthworm Jim (Megadrive)
  * Magic Carpet (Saturn)
  * Sonic Series (Megadrive)
  * Sonic CD (Mega CD)
  * The Division (XBONE)
  * DOOM (XBONE)
  * Destiny (XBONE)
  * Pokemon Gold (GBC)

That&#8217;s all I can think of!
