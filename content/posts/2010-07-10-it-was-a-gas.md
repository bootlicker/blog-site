<p>"What time is it?"</p>&#13;
<p>"Five?"</p>&#13;
<p>"Could you check?"</p>&#13;
<p>Sven shoved a sweaty hand into a jeans pocket.</p>&#13;
<p>"Yeah, five-something."</p>&#13;
<p>"We should head back - my folks left me dinner, you can have half."</p>&#13;
<p>"Sweet."</p>&#13;
<p>"Oh fuck."</p>&#13;
<p>"What?"</p>&#13;
<p>"I didn't bring my house key."</p>&#13;
<p>"Did you lock up?"</p>&#13;
<p>"Yeah."</p>&#13;
<p>Red and Sven stood on the corner of the movie complex for a moment, the evening air cooling. A small breeze built from the beach in the west.</p>&#13;
<p>"Hey, is that a microwave?"</p>&#13;
<p>Red cast her eyes across the road to see a lone microwave amongst a pile of other discarded junk on the verge of a block of flats.</p>&#13;
<p>"Yes?"</p>&#13;
<p>"You've got ten bucks right?" Sven began to cross the dual carriageway without waiting for an answer.</p>&#13;
<p>"What're you doing Sven?"</p>&#13;
<p>"Follow me! There's an Farmer Jacks just past - well it's over there somewhere!"</p>&#13;
<p>.</p>&#13;
<p>"How did you know we had outdoor power outlets?"</p>&#13;
<p>"Lucky guess."</p>&#13;
<p>Red took another mouthful of discount microwave tikka masala whilst thumbing through an astral projection book she had found on another verge.</p>&#13;
<p>"Does that stuff actually work?" Sven asked, mouth full of curry and instant rice.</p>&#13;
<p>"The book's waterlogged - I can't read the testimonals."</p>&#13;
<p>"Very funny."</p>
