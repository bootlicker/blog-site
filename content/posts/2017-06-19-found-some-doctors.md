Today I found a good GP and a good psychiatrist to go to. I initially had no idea where to go or who to see about my mental illness, but I now have a couple of good professionals who can support me. Thank goodness. I was so worried. My psychiatrist back in Perth told me he knew no-one here in my new city of Sydney. I couldn&#8217;t believe that he would say that, and I was beside myself: I have absolutely no advice to act on.

Well all that has changed now. Thank goodness.
