look at all this industry around us. toll roads, concrete, bitumen, portable generators, work all 
around the clock. outside my new house, jack hammering goes on all night. it is being done to build a 
privately owned tram network. the government, as usual, subsidised the construction, and will hand 
over the property to Capital for a song. none of this is useful work.

capitalism is the use of human labour and nature for increasing the bank account balances of 
australia's dictators. the exhausted human labourers deserve better, as they will be tossed aside and 
made unemployed when all this is done. the environment deserves better too.

i particularly like the maoist metaphor in /Breaking With Old Ideas/, of the red and yellow clay being 
combined by the Old Representative--production must be combined with correct political consciousness.

i swear to you all. we will smash this economic system and replace it with a proletarian one. i am 
even more resolute than ever.

forever forwards, never backwards.
