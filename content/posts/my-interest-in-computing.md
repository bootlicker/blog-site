I suppose my interest in computers as toys and pedagogical tools falls under 
what a lot of people these days call 'UX', but I do not like the concept of UX.

I think it pretty nebulous and vague. A lot of people wear their interest in UX 
as a badge of honour or pride, and I'm not really sure what they mean when they 
say they are highly interested in UX.

I suppose I haven't looked into it enough, but it does seem like a bit of jargon 
that Orwell, if he were a programmer, would not approve of.

Happy to be taken to school on this one though, as always. If I am wrong, I am 
wrong!
