I am suddenly very curious about 9front's kernel

I wonder if it's small and I can read it all

I wonder if it could be reimplemented in LISP or something, such a bizarre 
thought I had today while driving and helping comrades move house

I will install both Mezzano and 9front very soon

I know that just by using them, I will be contributing to the future of 
operating systems. I am ready to go beyond Linux, and I am ready to go beyond 
UNIX.
