<blockquote>&#13;
<p><span>Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,<br />Who never to himself hath said,<br />This is my own, my native land!<br />Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd,<br />As home his footsteps he hath turn'd<br />From wandering on a foreign strand!<br />If such there breathe, go, mark him well;<br />For him no Minstrel raptures swell;<br />High though his titles, proud his name,<br />Boundless his wealth as wish can claim;<br />Despite those titles, power, and pelf,<br />The wretch, concentred all in self,<br />Living, shall forfeit fair renown,<br />And, doubly dying, shall go down<br />To the vile dust, from whence he sprung,<br />Unwept, unhonour'd, and unsung.</span></p>&#13;
