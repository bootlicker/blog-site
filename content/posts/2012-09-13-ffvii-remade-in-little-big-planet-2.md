An article being passed around (see the original Kotaku article [here][1], and the ScrewAttack reblog [here][2]) Â reveals that someone has remade Final Fantasy VII using Little Big Planet 2. It can be a bit slow at times, but considering how difficult it is to use such a platform, it&#8217;s pretty cool.

Find the playlist [here][3].
