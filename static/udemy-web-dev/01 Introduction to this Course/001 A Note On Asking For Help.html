            <p>Hi Everyone!</p>

<p>As you work your way through the course, you are bound to run into trouble with your code.But don't worry, because wearehere to help!<br><br>You are always welcome to post a question in the Q&amp;A board, but before you do, please read through the following so wecan best assist you with your question.<br><br>First, before asking a question, use the Q&amp;A board search bar to determine whether or not the question has already been asked (and answered). If you cannot find a solution to your problem then please feel free to post a thread of your own.</p>





<p>When posting a question, one thing that is really important for us to help you out is remembering to<strong> provide enough context around yourcode.</strong>It's very hard for usto debug anything without seeing your exact code. You can share your code with usin a Q&amp;Athread by using the {...} code block button(first write your code, select it, then press the button).<br><br>However, when possible,weprefer to see your code in alive environmentso itcan berun right away and debugged more easily.</p>



<p>Here are some easy ways to share your code with us(and for usto share any tweaks or solutions that wefind, in return):</p>





<ul><li><a class="external-link" href="http://codepen.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Codepen</a> </li><li><a class="external-link" href="https://jsbin.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">JS Bin</a></li><li><a class="external-link" href="https://gist.github.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Github Gists</a> </li><li>Cloud9 (once you get to the backend section of the course)</li></ul>





<p>They all work great to share code.  It's really a matter of personal preference. </p>





<p>Another important resource that wehighly recommend is a screenshot sharing app called <a class="external-link" href="https://gyazo.com/download" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Gyazo</a>.  If you're trying to show ushow something looks in your browser or on your machine, it really helps usto see a screenshot.  Gyazo lets you take a screenshot and then it automatically uploads it for you.  It's really fast, and I actually used it for some of the screenshots Imade in this course. Udemy also allows you to upload screenshots from your computer via the image button (to the left of the code block button).</p><p>One last thing, if you ask a question then realize that you need to edit it, please edit the question directly instead of adding a comment with updated information. The reason being, if you answer your own question with a commentthen it gets marked as answered and removes itself from our unanswered questions notification system. The edit button can be found in the top right corner of your posted question by clicking on the three vertical dots and selecting the Edit option. Likewise, if another students answers your question, but the answer is not satisfactory, then you will need to either ask a new question or send a link to your current question as a direct messageto our <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/ianschoonover/" rel="nofollow">course TA</a>.</p>





<p>If you have any questions about any of the resources I recommended, please let usknow. Also, if you have other resources that you prefer to use, please share them with us!  Enjoy the rest of the course!</p>
